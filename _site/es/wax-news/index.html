<div class="text-center" style="max-width:560px; margin: 0 auto;"><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z5v-ghLJKeU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div>

<p><em>Transcript:</em></p>

<p><em>William: Hello, Megan is my partner at Magnetic Capital. She’ll be
walking us through Magnetic’s framework for how we view and find
investment opportunities for crypto. So Megan, share a little bit about
what Magnetic does.</em></p>

<p><em>Megan: Magnetic’s focus since 2012 has been purely crypto and
distributed ledger technology. We’ve watched the market evolve. The
changes in technology, the experimentation, the tax, the regulatory, and
the market changes. Our background is investors, company builders, and
merchants. Using blockchain technology gives us insight that few
investors can buy in this asset class. Our investment approach is
experience-based and research driven.</em></p>

<p><em>William: So what is special about crypto that makes it a compelling
investment opportunity?</em></p>

<p><em>Megan: The fact that it’s not yet a mature asset class. You can see
this from the relatively small market cap of crypto compared to other
asset classes. You also see this in the small user base. And we’re still
at a very early stage of enterprise adoption. And yet whether you look
at the past 10 years, the past 5 years, or even the past 3 years crypto
as an asset class has generated the highest return of any asset class
globally.</em></p>

<p><em>William: So Megan, is it too late to invest?</em></p>

<p><em>Megan: No. The crypto market opportunities are indicators for why we
believe these are still the early days of crypto. In the last decade the
crypto market achieved a return of 90,000x. Today, more developers,
companies, and governments are building blockchain solutions than ever
before. Over the next half a decade alone we can easily see a 5x market
growth. So no you’re not late to the game because you didn’t buy bitcoin
at $100</em></p>

<p><em>William: Are there specific opportunities you’re looking at?</em></p>

<p><em>Megan: Yes of course. Since the crypto market is in its nascent stages,
we take a long-term investment horizon approach. And in that approach,
we look at five main themes that are real world use cases for
blockchain. In the top 5 best use cases there are several sectors that
we look at such as payments, cross-border settlement, decentralized
finance, stablecoins, cloud wallets, tokenized real-world assets, data
collection and transfer, and gaming.</em></p>

<p><em>William: How do you invest in these use cases?</em></p>

<p><em>Megan: To invest in these use cases we look at the optimal way to
participate in any one of these global opportunities that I’ve laid out
which is influenced by the blockchain technology value creation stack.
We clearly do not use a simple heuristic approach. For instance, as an
investment approach we would not just invest in bitcoin and other top 10
protocol networks based on historical value. Most managers have used
this investment methodology. It worked a few years ago but it won’t be a
successful strategy going forward. This is because the focus is now on
practical business applications.</em></p>

<p><em>William: So Megan, thank you for coming here today and sharing your
insights about investing in crypto.</em></p>

<p><em>Megan: It’s my pleasure, thank you William, and thank you for
watching.</em></p>

<h1 id="wax-on-why-are-alt-coins-popping-on-calorie-free-announcements"><strong>WAX ON: Why are Alt Coins Popping on Calorie-Free Announcements?</strong></h1>

<div class="text-center" style="max-width:560px; margin: 0 auto;"><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v5sSy-VhHwM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div>

<p><em>Video Transcript:</em></p>

<p><em>I’ve noticed a weird phenomenon with some alt coins recently. These alt
coins make announcements about “partnerships” with brand name companies,
and their token prices shoot up on the news. Now that, in itself, is not
strange. But what IS WEIRD, is when you read the details of these
partnership deals, there’s nothing material to them. I mean, there
doesn’t seem to be a compelling reason why token holders would even
care.</em></p>

<p><em>Let me give you a couple of RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS that followed this
pattern. A project called Ultra, focused on the blockchain video gaming
sector, announced that it had secured a business development
relationship with Ubisoft - Ubisoft being a GIANT video game publisher.</em></p>

<p><em>Over several days, including a few days before the announcement - which
I assume means some people knew about it - Ultra’s token climbed 30%.</em></p>

<p><em>So I took a look at this deal. What I found was not a BIG DEAL. It was,
in my opinion, kind of a SILLY deal.</em></p>

<p><em>Ultra hadn’t secured an important partnership with one of the world’s
biggest video game companies. In fact, it was hard to figure out exactly
what the deal even was. I tried to scrape together some of the details,
but really, I can’t understand what all the fuss was about. If I have it
right, a technology lab subsidiary, inside Ubisoft, is going to produce
blocks, be a block producer, on Ultra’s TESTNET.Not a content
licensing deal. Ubisoft isn’t adopting the Ultra chain for all future
video games. Nope. Ubisoft is going to run a block producer server, on
Ultra’s testnet. Yet on this news, Ultra’s price moves 30% higher.</em></p>

<p><em>Now, I might chalk this up to a one-off, overexcited response to an
announcement. That happens. It even occasionally happens, on Wall
street. Where a group of traders misinterpret the significance of an
announcement, and push the buy button too fast.</em></p>

<p><em>But then, a few weeks later, it happens again. Curiously, with a
company, that also happens to be in the blockchain video gaming space.
ENJIN. A pretty well regarded Ethereum-based company, that makes
software for integrating blockchain and video gaming.</em></p>

<p><em>ENJIN reported that it had done a deal with Azure. Azure being the
enterprise cloud business unit, of Microsoft. How did the market react?
ENJIN’s token shot up 70% on the news. Amazing. Must be a truly
transformative deal, right? Nope, not so much. In fact, the deal was not
even with Microsoft overall, even though that is how it got picked up in
all the news coverage. The deal was with Azure, the enterprise cloud
division of Microsoft, the European division.</em></p>

<p><em>What was the NATURE of the deal, you might ask, that caused the Enjin
token to skyrocket 70%?. Well, the European division of Azure, said it
would be issuing, merit badges, NFT merit badges, to people who support
the Azure community.</em></p>

<p><em>Ok, but who cares? This is not a deal that seems like it’s going to
transform ENJIN’s business. Supplying Azure with some NFT’s that they
can issue to some members of their software community? Why would the
ENJIN price jump 70% on that news?</em></p>

<p><em>Now there are many reasons to like ENJIN. But the Azure deal, is not
one of them.</em></p>

<p><em>So here is my advice. Look underneath the hood, of these brand name
company partnership deals, before you rush out and buy the token. Apply
some basic scrutiny to the deal terms, see if it furthers the business
goals of the blockchain project doing the deal. Ask yourself, is this
deal evidence that the blockchain project is getting traction?</em></p>

<p><em>That’s my PSA for this week. If you liked what you heard on this video,

<h1 id="wax-to-use-chainlink-oracles-to-bring-off-chain-data-and-resources-to-the-wax-and-eosio-ecosystem"><strong>WAX to Use Chainlink Oracles to Bring Off-Chain Data and Resources to the WAX and EOSIO Ecosystem﻿</strong></h1>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mNH6oj1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>WAX is excited to announce its planned integration of Chainlink’s
decentralized oracle network to securely and reliably access data and
resources from outside the EOSIO ecosystem. WAX will use Chainlink to
obtain market data for DeFi products, source real-world events for
next-generation NFTs, and communicate cross-chain to other key
ecosystems such as Ethereum.</p>

<p>With this partnership, <strong>the entire WAX ecosystem gets</strong><strong>secure
access</strong><strong>to a variety of off-chain resources, such as random number
generation, token prices, sports events, IoT data, interoperability with
other chains, existing payment systems, enterprise backends, and much
more.</strong> This <strong>helps dApps avoid the major pitfalls with trying to
deploy their own oracles</strong>, such as excessive delays, extra expenses,
and even fatal security flaws.</p>

<p>By building support for WAX, Chainlink becomes accessible to EOSIO-based
chains for minimal cost, as all EOSIO chains utilize the same smart
contract language and are architected virtually identical to one
another. This will Chainlink the standard oracle solution used
exclusively by WAX and all other dApps in the EOSIO ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="wax-building-next-generation-dapps-using-chainlink-oracles"><strong>WAX Building Next-Generation dApps using Chainlink Oracles</strong></h2>

<p>The possibilities for easily integrating off-chain data into dApps on
the WAX Blockchain are endless, especially for games. For example you
can create a fantasy dApp game that retrieves live professional sports
scores, game plays, lineups and more. Or pull crypto and stock market
prices to create real-time accurate decentralized exchanges, games, and
applications.</p>

<p>That’s because by integrating Chainlink into the WAX Blockchain, a
variety of real-world applications become possible thanks to a secure
and reliable connection to existing non-blockchain infrastructure and
other blockchain ecosystems.</p>

<p>Some initial use cases we’re exploring using both WAX and Chainlink,
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data-Driven NFTs on the WAX Blockchain</strong>. Using our existing
partnerships, <a href="https://wax.io/blog/new-wax-and-topps-unveil-historic-blockchain-trading-card-partnership">such as with Topps for digital trading
cards</a>,
we can create NFTs that are subjective to real-world data. For
example, a special baseball card that’s only issued if someone
breaks the home run record.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ethereum NFTs and FTs on the WAX Blockchain.</strong>Chainlink provides a
bridge for broadcasting events happening on either chain to the
other one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Native DeFi products on the WAX Blockchain.</strong> Building our own
and/or using existing Chainlink’s <a href="https://feeds.chain.link/">Price Reference
Contracts</a> offer a secure, easy to deploy
solution for quickly launching DeFi instruments that rely on
accurate market data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A stablecoin for the -EOSIO ecosystem.</strong> This is something already
in high demand and very needed for financial stability. Given their
extensive experience building secure oracles, which is evident in
adoption by other stablecoin/currency projects, Chainlink is the
main and only trusted oracle for these applications.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-chainlink"><strong>Why Chainlink</strong></h2>

<p>Due to the way blockchains form consensus, they can only process
computation using data already stored inside the blockchain while still
retaining security. Similar to computer networks, blockchains can be far
more effective when connected to data and systems outside their
immediate network (off-chain).</p>

<p>Connecting off-chain is important, but only if the actual data and
delivery of that data is highly secure. What’s the point in having
secure underlying smart contracts running on a decentralized blockchain
if the connection off-chain is insecure?</p>

<p>An oracle is a digital agent employed by a smart contract to retrieve
and/or connect it to data and systems outside its native blockchain
(off-chain). Oracles enable this off-chain connectivity for the smart
contract by reformatting external connection points (APIs) so that two
different software applications are compatible for data exchange. The
oracles can then pull data into the smart contract and/or execute
actions on external systems based on predefined instructions and
endpoints.</p>

<p>Chainlink is unique in that it’s a decentralized oracle network that
currently provides decentralization at both the oracle and data source
level. By using multiple independent Chainlink nodes, the user can
protect against one oracle being a single point of failure. Similarly,
using multiple data sources for sourcing market prices, the user can
protect against one data source being a single source of truth.</p>

<p>It has a growing pool of 30 independent node operators run by leading
blockchain DevOps and security teams, many of which have extensive
experience running POS nodes across multiple blockchain networks.
Chainlink has a very expansive ecosystem of over 120+ projects,
representing multiple different blockchains and large enterprises, as
well as encompassing many different use cases, such as finance,
insurance, and regulated gaming. It currently has 29 Data Feeds for DeFi
(Price Reference Contracts) used by many top Ethereum dApps.</p>

<p>“Having a reliable and secure Layer 2 solution that augments the value
of our smart contract ecosystem is paramount to achieving real-world
adoption of WAX’s distributed blockchain applications (dApps),” says
Lukas Sliwka, Chief Technical Advisor, WAX. “WAX’s dApp developers gain
far more functionality when they can integrate with data and systems
outside the native blockchain, such as accessing token prices, sports
stats, etc. Chainlink will bridge that gap as the standard framework for
building provably secure and redundantly reliable oracle networks for
WAX and the EOSIO ecosystem, ultimately leading to next-generation dApps
that retrieve and respond to real-world data and events.”</p>

<h1 id="update-wax-labs-proposal-guidelines"><strong>Update: WAX Labs Proposal Guidelines</strong></h1>

<p>Since the launch of the WAX Labs worker proposal system on March 11,
we’ve been excited to see the number of projects submitted for funding!
Below we’ve provided more specific guidelines for how to make your
project more likely to be accepted into WAX Labs.\</p>

<p>The guidelines are not a formula: adhering to them won’t guarantee that
a project is accepted (and likewise, not following them won’t guarantee
that a project is rejected). The guidelines are simply to provide
candidates with the criteria for what makes a project more likely to be
accepted into WAX Labs.</p>

<p><strong>Guidelines:</strong></p>

<p>For the benefit of all participants, the WAX Tokens that will be granted
must fund projects that have a clear and measurable impact on the WAX
ecosystem. For this reason, projects are more likely to be accepted if
they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>**Valuable to the larger WAX community and ecosystem (not simply a
profit-generator for the candidate). **If the project’s primary goal
is for the candidate to profit from, and it lacks clear benefits to
the rest of the WAX ecosystem, the project will be subject to a
higher degree of scrutiny.</li>
  <li>**Requesting a reasonable number of WAX Tokens. **In general, the
more tokens that are requested to fund a project, the higher the
scrutiny of the project.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Within the limits of the number of tokens that will be granted per
project.</strong> You can request up to $100,000 worth of WAX Tokens for
your project, or 0.5% of the entire pool, whichever amount is lower
at the time of submission. If you have a bigger project in mind,
great! We recommend first submitting a smaller, lower cost MVP
(minimum viable product) version of your project, to prove that the
market and its participants want your larger-scale version of the
project. Doing so will increase the likelihood that your large-scale
project will be accepted (if the MVP version is a success).
Large-scale projects with no previous case study will be subject to
a higher degree of scrutiny.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Adhering to an incremental utility standard.</strong> This includes
consideration of:</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Measurably useful and/or valuable.</strong> Each phase of the project
completion must prove utility and community adoption. Projects that
have clearly defined goals that can be measured objectively, and
after each milestone, are more likely to be accepted.</li>
</ul>

<p>These guidelines are suggestions to help candidates submit projects that
are more likely to be accepted into the WAX Labs worker proposal system.
Adhering to none, all, or any of the above guidelines is not a guarantee
of acceptance or rejection; they are intended to provide clarity into
what factors are considered when the Reviewers accept or reject a
project. We look forward to seeing your project submissions, if you have
any questions, please join our communities:</p>

<h1 id="wax-on-the-future-of-nfts-non-fungible-tokens-in-2020-and-beyond"><strong>WAX ON: The future of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) in 2020 and beyond</strong></h1>

<div class="text-center" style="max-width:560px; margin: 0 auto;"><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Nyz_yd_GJw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div>

<p><em>Video Transcript:</em></p>

<p>I want to talk today about the future of NFTs, non-fungible tokens. Lots
of hype about NFTs, ever since Ethereum came out with its ERC-721
standard which really was a major innovation - being able to make every
token unique, in some particular way, opened the door for things like
dApp video gaming.</p>

<p>I said there has been a lot of hype about NFTs. And hype usually means
that what people are expecting to happen - in the near term - is a
little less grand than what is really going to happen. And this happens
ALL THE TIME in venture capital and the start-up culture. And there’s a
very specific reason for that. It’s because we can SEE the tremendous
potential of a new technology or (even better) a new business model. But
what we can CAN’T see are all these little problems that are going to
pop up once we start actually working with the new technology. This is
just how capitalism, start up life, entrepreneurship works.</p>

<p>And it’s exactly what I experienced in my early days at the idealab
incubator - idealab was the first consumer internet incubator in the
1990’s. And at idealab, we thought e-commerce was amazing. What an
improvement over mail order catalogs or trying to find that ONE BOOK at
your neighborhood book store. So we built a bunch of ecommerce sites:
Etoys, Cooking.com, Tickets.com, Music.com. This was the early days of
consumer internet. You could literally try to own a whole consumer
category. But what happened was once we built all these ecommerce
businesses we were like “Ok where is everybody?” Then we realized “Oh we
need internet marketing.” Whatever that is, because of course, no one
has ever done it. SO…how do you do that? So we figured out how to do
internet marketing. And companies like Double Click got invented and
made billions of dollars helping businesses do online advertising, and
then of course got acquired by Google.</p>

<p>So we figured out internet advertising, and we got people to show up to
our e-commerce sites using these new advertising inventions and then we
encountered another problem. “How come people aren’t buying much?” Well,
that’s when we found out about the payments problem. Payments was a huge
problem. Which is what led my partners and me to be the first
institutional investors in PayPal. We needed an innovation like PayPal
to make online shopping work, work for consumers, who demand
convenience. And by the way, at the time, credit card companies wanted
NOTHING to do with these questionable internet companies. In fact, even
if you could get a merchant credit card account for your e-commerce
company, you got charged 10%, 12%, 14% of the transaction in credit card
fees.</p>

<p>My point here is that as good as a new technology appears to be like
e-commerce, there is always some hidden friction in bringing that
technology to its full potential.</p>

<p>So about NFTs, these non-fungible tokens. As I look out here at the
beginning of 2020 at the hype around NFTs, there are things people
believe are right around the corner that I think are going to take
longer.</p>

<p>So let me run through a few of what I think those are:</p>

<p>The CONSENSUS view out there is that big video game companies are going
to start rushing in to incorporate NFTs into their hit video games. That
is not going to happen for a few years. You want to know why? Because
those big video game companies learned a lot of the lessons back when
they were small companies about adopting new technology and all the
friction that comes with it. So they’re cautious. They’re going to move
slow. As I’ve mentioned before, small, indie game developers will be the
first ones to experiment with, and even succeed with, NFTS.</p>

<p>Another consensus view right now about NFTs, is that people are just
going to start trading them like crazy. Nope, not going to happen. At
least not yet. Now, as a lot of you know, my partners and I spent the
past 20 years, running video game virtual item marketplaces. We know
this business. We also understand WHY people trade virtual items. At a
minimum, the trading PROCESS has to be simple. The single biggest
contribution to making that happen, is what we recently did with the WAX
Cloud Wallet. We’ve made it very simple to set up a blockchain account
and trade NFTs. There are now almost 500,000 customer accounts on the
WAX Blockchain in the past maybe three months because of the WAX Cloud
Wallet. But until large numbers of people move away from wallets like
Scatter and MetaMask, NFT trading will be limited. It’s just an emergent
behavior. You can’t just design some nice looking NFTs and expect people
are going to magically start trading them. People need a reason to do
things. And your job, if you’re a video game dApp designer, is to figure
out what will cause people to start trading. And that is still a work in
progress. Which is why I think massive trading right now is not going to
happen.</p>

<p>Let me mention one final consensus view about NFTs that’s wrong. That’s
leasing them. Yep. Leasing your NFTs. This has recently been getting a
lot of hype. But it’s not going to happen, in any material way, probably
ever. Why do I have such a strong opinion about this? Because its been
tried. Many times. For decades. Generally by people who don’t understand
video gamers. There is no evidence that video gamers want to lease skins
or NFTs. Just one possible problem that I see with the NFT leasing
market, is the fact that people own video game skins to show off. It’s a
way to say “Hey look at this expensive skin that I own, aren’t I
impressive?” But if anyone can inspect the blockchain and see that you
don’t own it, that you’re just a poser renting it, then you destroy the
whole reason you wanted the skin in the first place. This is just one
issue that I see, by the way. There’s many others.</p>

<p>Here is my advice on this one, this leasing NFT concept. If you can’t
come up with a super compelling reason why someone would want to rent or
lease a skin, then don’t waste time on it.</p>

<p>Let me finish here by saying that I have a few non-consensus views about
the future of NFTs. And in another upcoming video, I’m going to share
those with you. That’s it for now. If you liked what you heard on this
video, please hit subscribe, make a comment, and I’ll talk to you next
time.</p>

<p>Mar 2, 2020</p>

<h1 id="wax-and-topps-unveil-historic-blockchain-trading-card-partnership"><strong>WAX and Topps Unveil Historic Blockchain Trading Card Partnership</strong></h1>

<p>WAX and The Topps Company, the most prestigious global producer of
trading cards for MLB, Star Wars, WWE and Garbage Pail Kids, today
unveiled a historic partnership to bring their vast licensing portfolio
to the WAX Blockchain.</p>

<p>Utilizing WAX’s blockchain technology, fans around the world can now
discover, collect and trade officially-licensed digital Topps
collectibles. Collectibles can be seamlessly sold, or traded instantly
and securely, with anyone across the world. With blockchain
collectibles, collectors can enjoy the fun of trading and sharing
digital cards with others around the world through a secure and
efficient medium. The digital cards are authenticated and tracked using
WAX Blockchain technology to ensure providence and security.</p>

<p>The first Topps blockchain trading cards will launch in Spring 2020 and
will be available for purchase online using a credit card and the WAX
Cloud Wallet, the most user-friendly blockchain wallet today. To get on
the waitlist (and enter to win cards!), visit
<a href="http://topps.wax.io/">topps.wax.io</a>.</p>

<p>“Over the years, collectors of Topps trading cards have enjoyed the
thrill of ripping open a pack of cards. This partnership allows us to
bring that memorable collectible experience to an even wider audience.
Our Garbage Pail Kids blockchain product will highlight recent
advancements in technology and continues Topps’ history of developing
innovative products,” said Tobin Lent, Vice President, General Manager
of Topps Digital.</p>

<p>Topps trading cards have regularly sold in secondary markets for
hundreds of thousands of dollars, so it’s critical that WAX Blockchain
technology guarantee Topps cards are authentic and that trades are
secured.</p>

<p>By interacting with Garbage Pail Kids cards on the WAX Blockchain,
anyone can see the details of the cards’ information and trading
history. This enables everyone involved to make informed purchases,
sales, and trades, with anyone else in the world - instantly.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TPUdEYQ.png" alt="TOPPS ON THE WAX BLOCKCHAIN" /></p>

<p>The blockchain records every aspect of every card’s transaction and
stores it forever. These blockchain records can’t be changed by anyone,
and can be seen by everyone. Therefore, since the blockchain removes all
uncertainty, there’s no need to take a chance with a buyer or seller or
blindly trust another trader.</p>

<p>Data for Garbage Pail Kids cards on the blockchain includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Detailed product specifications</strong> for each card including the date
it was created, its rarity, images of the card, proof of its
authenticity, and more. With this information, collectors know
exactly which cards they are trading - no guesswork, no need to
trust or verify other traders.</li>
  <li><strong>Comprehensive ownership records</strong> that show who traded the card
and when. Since everyone can see its full ownership history, no one
can ever fake ownership of a card.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete trade and sale history</strong> including how much money was paid
for the cards and when. No one can ever fake previous sale prices or
dates.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Topps is bringing their collectibles to the forefront of digital
innovation and is determined to leverage the opportunities that the
blockchain can provide. I believe the WAX Blockchain will have an
important and positive impact on Topps future business models and the
way they engage their fanbase. We are very pleased to welcome Topps in
the WAX family of dApps.” said Evan Vandenberg, Director at WAX.</p>

<h1 id="one-of-the-most-popular-dapps-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-0xwarriors-is-coming-to-wax"><strong>One of the most popular dApps on the Ethereum blockchain, 0xWarriors, is coming to WAX</strong></h1>

<p>One of the most popular dApps on Ethereum is coming to the WAX
Blockchain. 0xGames, an open-economy game development company, is
integrating the <a href="https://wax.io/">WAX Blockchain</a> into both their arena
RPG game 
<a href="https://0xwarriors.com/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=WAX-to-WR">0xWarriors</a>
 and race manager game
 <a href="https://0xracers.com/?utm_source=cointelegraph&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=WAX-to-WR">0xRacers</a>
 in February, 2020.</p>

<p>The partnership is expected to promote cross-chain interaction for
gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike. 0xRacers and 0xWarriors already
boast the support of several chains, such as Ethereum, NEO, TRON, and
EOS, increasing overall interplay in the player base.</p>

<p>Players can buy, sell, and trade in-game items for 0xWarriors and
0xRacers using WAX Tokens. These NFTs can be of various rarity values
and, when equipped, allow gamers to customize their playing experience
and to curate collections. For example, a player can pick a
legendary-tier WAX helmet along with other equipable tokens and crush
their enemies on the Combat Arenas. Should a warrior need to swap their
WAX item to another one - it can be easily done on the in-game market
supporting NFT trade.</p>

<h1 id="wax-and-aikon-partner-to-bring-more-enterprise-viability-to-the-wax-blockchain"><strong>WAX and AIKON partner to bring more enterprise viability to the WAX Blockchain</strong></h1>

<p><img src="https://wax.io/uploads/aikon.png" alt="WAX and AIKON" /></p>

<p>WAX and AIKON are excited to announce a partnership that will bring
AIKON’s ORE ID blockchain identity service to the WAX Blockchain,
<strong>making it easy for developers and companies to get their customers
using WAX</strong>. AIKON will make their ORE ID API library, which is geared
toward <strong>streamlining enterprise adoption of blockchain solutions</strong>,
accessible to developers who build on WAX.</p>

<p>By partnering with AIKON, <strong>the WAX community benefits from increased
cross-chain compatibility, and it becomes easier for both small dApps
and enterprise-level applications to move onto WAX</strong>. AIKON’s ORE ID
provides numerous enterprise solutions including a completely seamless
blockchain on-ramp experience for existing centralized apps, a single
API library that supports multiple chains and data privacy conscious
identities.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ORE ID Enterprise</strong> provides one of the easiest ways for
enterprise customers to transition their existing users to the
blockchain and can be adapted to any onboarding experience.</li>
  <li><strong>ORE ID libraries</strong> will support a multitude of chains including
WAX, EOS, Ethereum, TRON and more, allowing developers to launch
their dapps on multiple chains easily with one API.</li>
  <li><strong>ORE ID as an identity solution</strong> was built with privacy and
security in mind and provides tools to manage GDPR and CCPA
compliance.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these solutions, <strong>dApps from other blockchains such as Ethereum
and TRON can easily port their application over to the WAX Blockchain.</strong>
And enterprises interested in adopting digital assets can leverage WAX’s
powerful asset exchange tools by migrating their users to the WAX chain.</p>

<p>AIKON has long been inspired by the team at WAX and the scale they’ve
been able to accomplish. “Everyone on our team loves WAX - <strong>especially
their focus on usability and mass adoption</strong>,” said Marc Blinder, CEO of
AIKON. “ORE ID brings that same emphasis on usability for centralized
companies that want to make the move to blockchain or dApps that want a
single sign-on solution for multiple chains.”</p>

<p>“WAX is really excited for AIKON to join the platform,” says Evan
Vandenberg, Director of Business Development for WAX. “<strong>AIKON’s
outstanding team has shown significant progress in onboarding
enterprise-level customers, outside of the blockchain space, to utilize
blockchain technology such as <a href="https://www.moonlighting.com/">Moonlighting.com</a>.</strong> I’m very excited
that the AIKON team can bring their impressive tech offerings to the WAX
development community. “</p>

<p>Together, AIKON and WAX hope to provide that tipping point that large
enterprises have been waiting for in their consideration to adopt a
blockchain strategy.</p>

<hr />

<p>About AIKON:</p>

<p>ORE ID was built from the ground up to leverage blockchain and manage
access rights to a user’s data. We knew from the beginning that
protecting a user would be critical to the mainstream adoption of
blockchain technologies, and data privacy compliance is one of the most
obvious, and in the current technological climate, paramount use cases
that can really deliver value and security to the masses.</p>

<h1 id="new-wax-and-liquidapps-collaborate-to-offer-high-powered-tools-to-developers"><strong>NEW: WAX and LiquidApps Collaborate to Offer High-Powered Tools to Developers</strong></h1>

<p>WAX and LiquidApps are excited to announce a collaboration that will
make WAX a remarkably scalable and interoperable blockchain for
decentralized applications. WAX will integrate LiquidApp’s DAPP Network,
providing developers who build on WAX with the most efficient and
cost-effective tools and environments.</p>

<p>The DAPP Network makes the development of dApps more affordable,
efficient and scalable through a range of products for developers,
service providers and users committed to scaling the blockchain. The
DAPP Network brings a of services to developers building on the
blockchain including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://liquidapps.io/liquid-link"><strong>LiquidLink</strong></a> allows dApp
developers to connect their dApp to assets, actions, and
applications on Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOSIO chains, and more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://liquidapps.io/liquid-oracles"><strong>LiquidOracles</strong></a> keep SLAs
and data verification on-chain, which protects dApp developers from
the risks of malicious or accidental failure.</li>
  <li><a href="https://liquidapps.io/vram"><strong>vRAM</strong></a> is an alternative storage
solution for developers building EOS dApps that is RAM-compatible,
decentralized, and enables storing &amp; retrieving of potentially
unlimited amounts of data affordably and efficiently.</li>
  <li><a href="https://liquidapps.io/zeus"><strong>Zeus SDK</strong></a> provides developers with
a set of libraries, code samples and documentation for building and
scaling dApps, while optimizing the utility of LiquidApp’s products.</li>
</ul>

<p>These solutions boost WAX’s scalability and cross-chain compatibility
with EOSIO chains as well as other blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin,
and others. It’s like having a Rosetta Stone for the major blockchains.</p>

<p>LiquidApps is excited by WAX’s rapid adoption by users and partners, and
the WAX Blockchain’s scalability potential. “<strong>We have been following
WAX developments closely and we are thrilled to see WAX enable the DAPP
Network to enhance their growing ecosystem</strong>,” says Beni Hakak, CEO
LiquidApps. “The services running on the DAPP Network can <strong>help WAX
developers by offering them more cost-efficient resources, more
flexibility, and more trustless functionality when building their
dApps, keeping WAX at the tip of the spear of blockchain innovation.
This move sets the stage for networks of interoperable, integrated
blockchains to emerge.</strong>“</p>

<p>By bringing the best toolsets and products for developers wanting to
build on WAX, we’re creating an easier and more cost-effective
environment for dApps to operate in.</p>

<h1 id="new-the-wax-testnet-is-now-live"><strong>NEW: The WAX Testnet is now live</strong></h1>

<p>Jan 6, 2020</p>

<p>Yet another resource for developers to build on WAX is now live - the
WAX Testnet. With the WAX Testnet, anyone can explore building on the
WAX Blockchain for free. It’s “perfect for testing dApps, node setup, or
just exploring the features of WAX,” says <a href="https://waxsweden.org/"><em>WAX
sw/eden</em></a>, the WAX Guild that built the WAX
Testnet.</p>

<p><strong>Visit the</strong> <a href="https://developer.wax.io/dapps/wax-testnet-quickstart/"><strong>WAX Developer Hive
Quickstart</strong></a> <strong>for
the WAX Testnet to learn</strong> how to create Testnet accounts and deploy
your smart contracts to the WAX Testnet, and visit the <a href="https://developer.wax.io/dapps/blockchain-environments/"><strong>WAX
Blockchain
Environments</strong></a> <strong>section
for WAX versions, URLs, and development environment information. You
can also access <em>WAX sw/eden</em></strong><strong>’s resources for the WAX Testnet and
create an account</strong> <a href="https://waxsweden.org/testnet/"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Developers can benefit from using the WAX Testnet in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Free testing environment:</strong> The WAX Testnet provides devs with
free test WAX Tokens, which means you can see how your dApp will
work on WAX without having to pay for resources</li>
  <li><strong>Migration made easy:</strong> If you have a dApp running on another
blockchain, you can test the migration using the WAX Testnet before
deploying on the WAX Blockchain mainnet</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment with WAX services (coming soon):</strong> Integrate and test
WAX features such as the <a href="https://wax.io/blog/introducing-the-wax-cloud-wallet-the-last-mile-in-blockchain-has-been-solved">WAX Cloud
Wallet</a>,

<h1 id="new-customers-can-automatically-login-to-wax-dapps-with-this-new-wax-developer-portal-quickstart"><strong>NEW: Customers can automatically login to WAX dApps with this new WAX Developer Portal quickstart</strong></h1>

<p>We’ve added a feature to WAX Cloud Wallet that <strong>allows dApp customers
to automatically log in to their favorite WAX dApps, making it even
faster and easier to start using applications that run on the WAX
Blockchain.</strong></p>

<p>With the <a href="https://developer.wax.io/waa/use-waxjs/">WaxJS quickstart</a>,
developers can run a simple, secure check that will let customers
automatically sign into the dApp any time they access it.</p>

<p>Before you can start signing transactions from your dApp, a customer
must be logged in. WaxJS includes an isAutoLoginAvailable function that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Securely checks for WAX Cloud Wallet credentials</li>
  <li>Checks to see if your dApp is whitelisted</li>
</ul>

<p>If both conditions are true, a customer’s userAccount and public keys
are set in your WaxJS object, and you don’t need to call the login()
function. You’ll also have access to wax.userAccount and wax.pubKeys.</p>

<p>Customers save clicks and time, so they can start using your dApp in
just seconds.</p>

<p>Want to see how it works? See the autologin feature in action
