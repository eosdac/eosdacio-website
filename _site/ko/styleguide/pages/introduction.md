These guidelines have been created to help current and future workers of eosDAC how to use eosDAC brand features correctly. </br>
At the moment the style guide  is very basic, but should evolve over time.

To get the style guide running on you local mashine:</br>

Astrum has obviously a problem with newer Versions of node.js!

For Windows:</br>
1.) Download version node-v8.3.0-x86.msi from https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/</br>
2.) Create a folder on c: for example C:/repos</br>
3.) Pull the repo from https://github.com/eosdac/astrum  into your created folder (GitDesktop is a great Tool for this https://desktop.github.com/)</br>
4.) Open the Comand-Line Tool (CMD)</br>
5.)In the Comand-Line Tool go to your created folder C:/repos</br>
6.)Type in: npm install -g astrum</br>
7.)A Documentation can be found here: https://github.com/eosdac/astrum</br>
8.) no need to execute: ./public/pattern-library the pattern library is already created.</br>

Hope that helps nod74 :)
