<p><em>This article is translated from the original Chinese publication of the
same date transcribing an AMA with Simon.</em></p>

<p>At 15:00 on April 8th, Beijing time, BOSCore developer Simon was a guest
of the BOSCore ecosystem and shared “How the BOS IBC Hub allows the
blockchain to achieve multi-chain interaction”.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RtOAWel.png" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>

<p>on 8 April 2020, Katherine from BOSCore started an AMA session with an
announcement about the release of BOS IBC v4.0.0 and proceeded to
introduce Simon Wang to answer questions provided by BOSCore and EOSIO
community members from around the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today we invited BOSCore developer Simon to answer questions from the
community and talk with us in detail about the BOS IBC Hub, and what
the Hub brings to BOSCore and the wider EOSIO ecosystem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="ama-question-and-answer-session"><strong>AMA Question and Answer session.</strong></h1>

<p><strong><em>Q1: What is IBC Hub?</em></strong></p>

<p>The IBC Hub implements Token cross-chain switch and relay functions, the
Hub in this context functions as a central token exchange.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ly6CYoy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A star-shaped cross-chain network is realized through the IBC Hub, the
middle chain becomes the Hub Chain, and all the chains are called
parallel chains.</p>

<p>After BOS implements the Hub, Tokens from other parallel chains
connected to BOS can be easily transferred between the connected chains,
such as the EOS mainnet and Telos mainnet. They have already achieved
cross-chain functionality with the BOS mainnet. With the deployment of
the Hub, you can transfer from EOS to any destination account on the
Telos mainnet without requiring a BOS account, as the hub acts
independently enabling seamless transaction throughput to the
destination account.</p>

<p>The IBC Hub protocol is very flexible, you can transfer any registered
Token, from one parallel chain to another parallel chain.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Q2: What is the cross-chain implementation? How to achieve
homogeneous cross-chain?</em></strong></p>

<p>In fact, we have answered this question many times, the core principle
is from the bitcoin white paper which mentions “ simple proof of payment
,” known as Simple Payment Verification (SPV).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/boscore/Documentation/blob/master/IBC/EOSIO_IBC_Priciple_and_Design.md">boscore/Documentation</a></p>

<h2 id="boscoredocumentation">boscore/Documentation</h2>

<h3 id="this-paper-introduces-the-technical-principle-of-ibc-the-contracts-and-ibc_plugin-developed-by-boscore-team-in-order">This paper introduces the technical principle of IBC, the contracts and ibc_plugin developed by boscore team. In order…</h3>

<h4 id="githubcom">github.com</h4>

<p>At present, Some protocols in the development stage can be said to be
homogeneous cross-chains, E.g, two cross-chain projects Cosmos and
polkadot. The so-called isomorphic interoperability means that the two
chains have the same or similar block header structure and logic, such
as EOSIO , BOSCore, and Telos are isomorphic chains. In fact, BOSCore
and other chains are already quite different in certain core data
structures, so they can achieve 3s LIB. For heterogeneous cross-chains,
special bridges are required, for example, to achieve cross-chain with
the Bitcoin network. In this regard, both Cosmos and polkadot are quite
involved. Heterogeneous cross-chains are generally implemented by
multiple witnesses.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q3: Cosmos also launched Cosmos Hub some time ago. Is there any
similarity and difference with BOS Hub?</em></strong></p>

<p>From the user’s point of view, we have referred to chains connected to
BOS Hub as Parallel chains, Cosmos calls them Zone chains, BOS Hub and
Cosmos Hub both support bi-directional token transfers between connected
chains. Their implementation principles are also very closely based on
light client and SPV proof technology .</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q4: Do you think cross-chain will develop into a standardized
protocol in the future, just like TCP is to the Internet, instead of
relying on a specific chain?</em></strong></p>

<p>This is an important issue. At present, it seems that the world of
public chains is still far away. However, due to national guidance and
the participation of some standard-setting agencies in the field of
alliance chains, cross-chain standards may appear earlier.</p>

<p>Existing blockchains have their own data formats and consensus
algorithms, such as bitcoin, ethereum, EOSIO, etc., which are very
different. Therefore, the design of light clients in different chains is
very different. Only when many blockchains use similar protocols can
standards be formed when there are consensus and block data structure
considerations involved.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q5: Can you introduce the development process of BOS IBC, did v1-v4
have different function iterations? What do you think is the biggest
challenge to achieve IBC V4?</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>v1 implemented two-way cross-chain between the BOS main network and
the EOS main network. At that time, the consensus of BOS and EOS was
pipeline-bft.</li>
  <li>v2 implements the batch-pbft consensus algorithm that supports BOS,
which is BOS’s 3s LIB. Token cross-chain speed from BOS to EOS is
faster.</li>
  <li>v3 This is a small change. The code adds control to check the relay
permissions. Because the underlying protocol is modified and it is
not compatible with the previous version.</li>
  <li>v4 is the realization of the Hub protocol, and the chain that
deploys the Hub version contract can be used as a central
cross-chain exchange, switching and relaying tokens, memo data, and
so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Hub protocol is based on the original IBC protocol. Because the IBC
protocol itself is designed to be sufficiently complete and flexible, it
is easier to implement the Hub protocol without too much difficulty.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q6 : The IBC protocol only supports simple value transfer, that is,
sending tokens across chains. When will it support the transmission of
more information, such as cross-chain action interoperability?</em></strong></p>

<p>This needs to have enough demand to know how to abstract into a
standard. At present, there are few needs in this regard, so currently
cross-chain token and memo data is supported.</p>

<p>If you have a project that needs this, you can transfer the custom
parameter actions across the chains through the memo string of the
transfer action.</p>

<p>So in this sense, BOS IBC already supports the transmission of more
information and cross-chain action interoperability.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q7: If someone wants to add their custom tokens to the IBC network,
is it currently feasible? How to set it up?</em></strong></p>

<p>Of course, it is very feasible, Tokens need to register to circulate on
each chain, (refer to the GitHub documentation and contact BOSCore) the
IBC team can audit registration and any token can be registered for IBC
circulation.</p>

<p>The audit is to check token parameters and see if there are any errors,
it adds convenience for token holders, and can also prevent the
counterfeiting of tokens. There are many parameters, and submitting
information to the IBC contract requires the permission of the ibc.token
contract, which requires multiple signatures to complete and is also
decentralized in itself.</p>

<p>Any project that would like to add a custom token can start the process
by reviewing the information on github and completing a form to notify
the IBC working group</p>

<h4 id="githubcom-1">github.com</h4>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q8: All cross-chain communication is completed through Hub as the
central agent. Will this violate the original intention of blockchain
decentralization?</em></strong></p>

<p>Good question, we provide a total of two protocols, they are layered:
one is the IBC protocol, and the other is the HUB protocol.</p>

<p>The HUB protocol is based on the IBC protocol, the purpose is to
facilitate the conversion of one token across two chains. The IBC
protocol is a completely decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that can
form an arbitrary mesh structure to form a truly decentralized
cross-chain network. And the HUB protocol is required to realize a token
transfer across any two chains, the concept is switching and routing at
the center of the chain network through to the destination. Cosmos and
polkadot are similar star structures, IBC contract accounts are
ultimately handed over to BP for multi-signature control, and
individuals cannot operate, So it does not violate the original
intention of decentralization.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q9 : What happens to tokens transferred from one chain to another?
Will it burn on the chain that sends tokens?</em></strong></p>

<p>Depends on the specific transfer direction, IBC token contracts on
Parallel chains that issues the original token will not burn tokens
unless it was released back to the native chain from other chains where
it would burn.</p>

<p>For real cross-chains, these tokens do not really cross over in essence
but lock on the native chain, and then generate the same number of
Tokens with the same name on the destination chain. When these tokens
are transferred back to the original chain, they will burn, and then the
original chain will transfer the locked token to the specified account.</p>

<p>Through the IBC protocol , an anchor between tokens is realized, that is
to say, the amount of mobile coins is conserved during the cross-chain
process, just like the conservation of energy.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q10 : Who charges the fee? Is the network operating the contract or
the block producers?</em></strong></p>

<p>Relay charges, because relays promote transactions. The more
straightforward point is that according to the spirit of PoW, the
service fee is only charged for the work. There are many transactions in
cross-chain protocols that require people to push the transactions. We
designed the system so that whoever pushes this transaction will pay the
transaction fee.</p>

<h1 id="brainstorming"><strong>Brainstorming</strong></h1>

<p><strong><em>Q1 : Do the chains connected together need to use the same EOSIO
version?</em></strong></p>

<p>No, different chains have their own version numbers, and there may be a
lot of modifications, such as BOSCore.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q2: Is direct transfer between EOS and Wax allowed?</em></strong></p>

<p>After Wax is connected to the BOS Hub direct transfers pass through the
hub completing the transfer of funds between any destination parallel
chain that is configured on the network to accept WAX transfers.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q3: How long does it take to cross-chain from BOS to EOS? How long
will it take for the two chains to cross the chain after HUB goes
live?</em></strong></p>

<p>It is now less than 10 seconds, the Hub is online, and the calculation
method of cross-chain between parallel chains is 3.5 minutes + 10
seconds. 3.5 minutes is an approximate time, this is because other
chains still use pipeline bft; 10 seconds is because BOS has 3s LIB.#</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q4.1: If BOS is the HUB and two EOSs are parallel chains, EOSA-&gt;
BOS-&gt; EOSB, then EOSA and EOSB run a relay node respectively, must BOS
run two relay nodes to connect with EOSA and EOSB ?</em></strong></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Q4.2: Is it possible for BOS to only run one public relay node?</em></strong></p>

<p>No, because different parallel chains belong to different networks, and
the data structure may also be different, so it cannot be done.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTOs4RU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Q5: At present, the memo field occupies more when cross-chaining. The
current business needs require the memo to bring business information
when sending a transaction. Is it possible to optimize this?</em></strong></p>

<p>The logic of the IBC plug-in is more complicated. You can refer to
net_plugin. If net_plugin is connected to multiple blockchain
networks, its complexity will increase exponentially. There is little
room for optimization at the protocol level. If you encounter a length
limitation, we can see how to extend the memo length.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>Mar 18, 2020</p>

<h1 id="wax-to-use-chainlink-oracles-to-bring-off-chain-data-and-resources-to-the-wax-and-eosio-ecosystem"><strong>WAX to Use Chainlink Oracles to Bring Off-Chain Data and Resources to the WAX and EOSIO Ecosystem﻿</strong></h1>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mNH6oj1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>WAX is excited to announce its planned integration of Chainlink’s
decentralized oracle network to securely and reliably access data and
resources from outside the EOSIO ecosystem. WAX will use Chainlink to
obtain market data for DeFi products, source real-world events for
next-generation NFTs, and communicate cross-chain to other key
ecosystems such as Ethereum.</p>

<p>With this partnership, <strong>the entire WAX ecosystem gets</strong><strong>secure
access</strong><strong>to a variety of off-chain resources, such as random number
generation, token prices, sports events, IoT data, interoperability with
other chains, existing payment systems, enterprise backends, and much
more.</strong> This <strong>helps dApps avoid the major pitfalls with trying to
deploy their own oracles</strong>, such as excessive delays, extra expenses,
and even fatal security flaws.</p>

<p>By building support for WAX, Chainlink becomes accessible to EOSIO-based
chains for minimal cost, as all EOSIO chains utilize the same smart
contract language and are architected virtually identical to one
another. This will Chainlink the standard oracle solution used
exclusively by WAX and all other dApps in the EOSIO ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="wax-building-next-generation-dapps-using-chainlink-oracles"><strong>WAX Building Next-Generation dApps using Chainlink Oracles</strong></h2>

<p>The possibilities for easily integrating off-chain data into dApps on
the WAX Blockchain are endless, especially for games. For example you
can create a fantasy dApp game that retrieves live professional sports
scores, game plays, lineups and more. Or pull crypto and stock market
prices to create real-time accurate decentralized exchanges, games, and
applications.</p>

<p>That’s because by integrating Chainlink into the WAX Blockchain, a
variety of real-world applications become possible thanks to a secure
and reliable connection to existing non-blockchain infrastructure and
other blockchain ecosystems.</p>

<p>Some initial use cases we’re exploring using both WAX and Chainlink,
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data-Driven NFTs on the WAX Blockchain</strong>. Using our existing
partnerships, <a href="https://wax.io/blog/new-wax-and-topps-unveil-historic-blockchain-trading-card-partnership">such as with Topps for digital trading
cards</a>,
we can create NFTs that are subjective to real-world data. For
example, a special baseball card that’s only issued if someone
breaks the home run record.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ethereum NFTs and FTs on the WAX Blockchain.</strong>Chainlink provides a
bridge for broadcasting events happening on either chain to the
other one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Native DeFi products on the WAX Blockchain.</strong> Building our own
and/or using existing Chainlink’s <a href="https://feeds.chain.link/">Price Reference
Contracts</a> offer a secure, easy to deploy
solution for quickly launching DeFi instruments that rely on
accurate market data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A stablecoin for the -EOSIO ecosystem.</strong> This is something already
in high demand and very needed for financial stability. Given their
extensive experience building secure oracles, which is evident in
adoption by other stablecoin/currency projects, Chainlink is the
main and only trusted oracle for these applications.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-chainlink"><strong>Why Chainlink</strong></h2>

<p>Due to the way blockchains form consensus, they can only process
computation using data already stored inside the blockchain while still
retaining security. Similar to computer networks, blockchains can be far
more effective when connected to data and systems outside their
immediate network (off-chain).</p>

<p>Connecting off-chain is important, but only if the actual data and
delivery of that data is highly secure. What’s the point in having
secure underlying smart contracts running on a decentralized blockchain
if the connection off-chain is insecure?</p>

<p>An oracle is a digital agent employed by a smart contract to retrieve
and/or connect it to data and systems outside its native blockchain
(off-chain). Oracles enable this off-chain connectivity for the smart
contract by reformatting external connection points (APIs) so that two
different software applications are compatible for data exchange. The
oracles can then pull data into the smart contract and/or execute
actions on external systems based on predefined instructions and
endpoints.</p>

<p>Chainlink is unique in that it’s a decentralized oracle network that
currently provides decentralization at both the oracle and data source
level. By using multiple independent Chainlink nodes, the user can
protect against one oracle being a single point of failure. Similarly,
using multiple data sources for sourcing market prices, the user can
protect against one data source being a single source of truth.</p>

<p>It has a growing pool of 30 independent node operators run by leading
blockchain DevOps and security teams, many of which have extensive
experience running POS nodes across multiple blockchain networks.
Chainlink has a very expansive ecosystem of over 120+ projects,
representing multiple different blockchains and large enterprises, as
well as encompassing many different use cases, such as finance,
insurance, and regulated gaming. It currently has 29 Data Feeds for DeFi
(Price Reference Contracts) used by many top Ethereum dApps.</p>

<p>“Having a reliable and secure Layer 2 solution that augments the value
of our smart contract ecosystem is paramount to achieving real-world
adoption of WAX’s distributed blockchain applications (dApps),” says
Lukas Sliwka, Chief Technical Advisor, WAX. “WAX’s dApp developers gain
far more functionality when they can integrate with data and systems
outside the native blockchain, such as accessing token prices, sports
stats, etc. Chainlink will bridge that gap as the standard framework for
building provably secure and redundantly reliable oracle networks for
WAX and the EOSIO ecosystem, ultimately leading to next-generation dApps
that retrieve and respond to real-world data and events.”</p>

<h1 id="wax-on-the-future-of-nfts-non-fungible-tokens-in-2020-and-beyond"><strong>WAX ON: The future of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) in 2020 and beyond</strong></h1>

<div class="text-center" style="max-width:560px; margin: 0 auto;"><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Nyz_yd_GJw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div>

<p><em>Video Transcript:</em></p>

<p>I want to talk today about the future of NFTs, non-fungible tokens. Lots
of hype about NFTs, ever since Ethereum came out with its ERC-721
standard which really was a major innovation - being able to make every
token unique, in some particular way, opened the door for things like
dApp video gaming.</p>

<p>I said there has been a lot of hype about NFTs. And hype usually means
that what people are expecting to happen - in the near term - is a
little less grand than what is really going to happen. And this happens
ALL THE TIME in venture capital and the start-up culture. And there’s a
very specific reason for that. It’s because we can SEE the tremendous
potential of a new technology or (even better) a new business model. But
what we can CAN’T see are all these little problems that are going to
pop up once we start actually working with the new technology. This is
just how capitalism, start up life, entrepreneurship works.</p>

<p>And it’s exactly what I experienced in my early days at the idealab
incubator - idealab was the first consumer internet incubator in the
1990’s. And at idealab, we thought e-commerce was amazing. What an
improvement over mail order catalogs or trying to find that ONE BOOK at
your neighborhood book store. So we built a bunch of ecommerce sites:
Etoys, Cooking.com, Tickets.com, Music.com. This was the early days of
consumer internet. You could literally try to own a whole consumer
category. But what happened was once we built all these ecommerce
businesses we were like “Ok where is everybody?” Then we realized “Oh we
need internet marketing.” Whatever that is, because of course, no one
has ever done it. SO…how do you do that? So we figured out how to do
internet marketing. And companies like Double Click got invented and
made billions of dollars helping businesses do online advertising, and
then of course got acquired by Google.</p>

<p>So we figured out internet advertising, and we got people to show up to
our e-commerce sites using these new advertising inventions and then we
encountered another problem. “How come people aren’t buying much?” Well,
that’s when we found out about the payments problem. Payments was a huge
problem. Which is what led my partners and me to be the first
institutional investors in PayPal. We needed an innovation like PayPal
to make online shopping work, work for consumers, who demand
convenience. And by the way, at the time, credit card companies wanted
NOTHING to do with these questionable internet companies. In fact, even
if you could get a merchant credit card account for your e-commerce
company, you got charged 10%, 12%, 14% of the transaction in credit card
fees.</p>

<p>My point here is that as good as a new technology appears to be like
e-commerce, there is always some hidden friction in bringing that
technology to its full potential.</p>

<p>So about NFTs, these non-fungible tokens. As I look out here at the
beginning of 2020 at the hype around NFTs, there are things people
believe are right around the corner that I think are going to take
longer.</p>

<p>So let me run through a few of what I think those are:</p>

<p>The CONSENSUS view out there is that big video game companies are going
to start rushing in to incorporate NFTs into their hit video games. That
is not going to happen for a few years. You want to know why? Because
those big video game companies learned a lot of the lessons back when
they were small companies about adopting new technology and all the
friction that comes with it. So they’re cautious. They’re going to move
slow. As I’ve mentioned before, small, indie game developers will be the
first ones to experiment with, and even succeed with, NFTS.</p>

<p>Another consensus view right now about NFTs, is that people are just
going to start trading them like crazy. Nope, not going to happen. At
least not yet. Now, as a lot of you know, my partners and I spent the
past 20 years, running video game virtual item marketplaces. We know
this business. We also understand WHY people trade virtual items. At a
minimum, the trading PROCESS has to be simple. The single biggest
contribution to making that happen, is what we recently did with the WAX
Cloud Wallet. We’ve made it very simple to set up a blockchain account
and trade NFTs. There are now almost 500,000 customer accounts on the
WAX Blockchain in the past maybe three months because of the WAX Cloud
Wallet. But until large numbers of people move away from wallets like
Scatter and MetaMask, NFT trading will be limited. It’s just an emergent
behavior. You can’t just design some nice looking NFTs and expect people
are going to magically start trading them. People need a reason to do
things. And your job, if you’re a video game dApp designer, is to figure
out what will cause people to start trading. And that is still a work in
progress. Which is why I think massive trading right now is not going to
happen.</p>

<p>Let me mention one final consensus view about NFTs that’s wrong. That’s
leasing them. Yep. Leasing your NFTs. This has recently been getting a
lot of hype. But it’s not going to happen, in any material way, probably
ever. Why do I have such a strong opinion about this? Because its been
tried. Many times. For decades. Generally by people who don’t understand
video gamers. There is no evidence that video gamers want to lease skins
or NFTs. Just one possible problem that I see with the NFT leasing
market, is the fact that people own video game skins to show off. It’s a
way to say “Hey look at this expensive skin that I own, aren’t I
impressive?” But if anyone can inspect the blockchain and see that you
don’t own it, that you’re just a poser renting it, then you destroy the
whole reason you wanted the skin in the first place. This is just one
issue that I see, by the way. There’s many others.</p>

<p>Here is my advice on this one, this leasing NFT concept. If you can’t
come up with a super compelling reason why someone would want to rent or
lease a skin, then don’t waste time on it.</p>

<p>Let me finish here by saying that I have a few non-consensus views about
the future of NFTs. And in another upcoming video, I’m going to share
those with you. That’s it for now. If you liked what you heard on this
video, please hit subscribe, make a comment, and I’ll talk to you next
time.</p>

and, when equipped, allow gamers to customize their playing experience
and to curate collections. For example, a player can pick a
legendary-tier WAX helmet along with other equipable tokens and crush
their enemies on the Combat Arenas. Should a warrior need to swap their
WAX item to another one - it can be easily done on the in-game market
supporting NFT trade.</p>

<h1 id="wax-and-aikon-partner-to-bring-more-enterprise-viability-to-the-wax-blockchain"><strong>WAX and AIKON partner to bring more enterprise viability to the WAX Blockchain</strong></h1>

<p><img src="https://wax.io/uploads/aikon.png" alt="WAX and AIKON" /></p>

<p>WAX and AIKON are excited to announce a partnership that will bring
AIKON’s ORE ID blockchain identity service to the WAX Blockchain,
<strong>making it easy for developers and companies to get their customers
using WAX</strong>. AIKON will make their ORE ID API library, which is geared
toward <strong>streamlining enterprise adoption of blockchain solutions</strong>,
accessible to developers who build on WAX.</p>

<p>By partnering with AIKON, <strong>the WAX community benefits from increased
cross-chain compatibility, and it becomes easier for both small dApps
and enterprise-level applications to move onto WAX</strong>. AIKON’s ORE ID
provides numerous enterprise solutions including a completely seamless
blockchain on-ramp experience for existing centralized apps, a single
API library that supports multiple chains and data privacy conscious
identities.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ORE ID Enterprise</strong> provides one of the easiest ways for
enterprise customers to transition their existing users to the
blockchain and can be adapted to any onboarding experience.</li>
  <li><strong>ORE ID libraries</strong> will support a multitude of chains including
WAX, EOS, Ethereum, TRON and more, allowing developers to launch
their dapps on multiple chains easily with one API.</li>
  <li><strong>ORE ID as an identity solution</strong> was built with privacy and
security in mind and provides tools to manage GDPR and CCPA
compliance.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these solutions, <strong>dApps from other blockchains such as Ethereum
and TRON can easily port their application over to the WAX Blockchain.</strong>
And enterprises interested in adopting digital assets can leverage WAX’s
powerful asset exchange tools by migrating their users to the WAX chain.</p>

<p>AIKON has long been inspired by the team at WAX and the scale they’ve
been able to accomplish. “Everyone on our team loves WAX - <strong>especially
their focus on usability and mass adoption</strong>,” said Marc Blinder, CEO of
AIKON. “ORE ID brings that same emphasis on usability for centralized
companies that want to make the move to blockchain or dApps that want a
single sign-on solution for multiple chains.”</p>

<p>“WAX is really excited for AIKON to join the platform,” says Evan
Vandenberg, Director of Business Development for WAX. “<strong>AIKON’s
outstanding team has shown significant progress in onboarding
enterprise-level customers, outside of the blockchain space, to utilize
blockchain technology such as <a href="https://www.moonlighting.com/">Moonlighting.com</a>.</strong> I’m very excited
that the AIKON team can bring their impressive tech offerings to the WAX
development community. “</p>

<p>Together, AIKON and WAX hope to provide that tipping point that large
enterprises have been waiting for in their consideration to adopt a
blockchain strategy.</p>

<hr />

<p>About AIKON:</p>

<p>ORE ID was built from the ground up to leverage blockchain and manage
access rights to a user’s data. We knew from the beginning that
protecting a user would be critical to the mainstream adoption of
blockchain technologies, and data privacy compliance is one of the most
obvious, and in the current technological climate, paramount use cases
that can really deliver value and security to the masses.</p>
