# Documentation of the eosDAC.io website

This website is a community effort. Everybody is welcome to propose changes or translations via Github [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests). This git repository contains the source of the website (`master` branch), which can be used to generate the real website HTML-code, using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static website generator and deploy the website to a web server (via `deploy` branch).

### Here you can find out how to
 * [Quickstart](00-quickstart.md)
 * [Translate a page](01-translate.md)
 * [Create a new page](02-create-page.md)
 * [Submit a pull request](03-pull-request.md)
 * [Run the website locally](04-run-local.md), to see your changes in real time

### Recommended tools
To work on the website all you need is a simple text editor (e.g. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)), the [GitHub Desktop tool](https://desktop.github.com/) (or a CLI [git client](https://git-scm.com/)) and a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

To make your life easier, it is recommended to use an advanced text editor, supporting the [Markdown syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) for text formatting and project wide full-text search, like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/). If not using an advanced editor, you should at least consider a [Markdown online editor](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/).

To run a local copy of the website, where you can see the live changes you make, you need to install the [Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) development tools.
