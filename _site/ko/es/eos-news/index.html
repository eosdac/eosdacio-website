<h1 id="smartpress-is-the-smart-contract-cloud">Smartpress Is The Smart Contract Cloud</h1>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Smartpress-BulitOnEOSIO-1024x585.jpg" alt="Smartpress is the smart contract
cloud" /></p>

<p>We interviewed Lachlan Greenbank, CEO and founder of Smartpress, about
their platform that simplifies using EOSIO Smart Contracts for
businesses.</p>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Smart-contract-cloud-logo-1024x307.png" alt="Smart contract cloud
logo" /></p>

<h2 id="could-you-introduce-smartpress-for-us">Could you introduce Smartpress for us?</h2>

<p>Smartpress is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that lets you
rapidly connect your apps to an EOSIO Smart Contract.</p>

<p>We describe Smartpress as: “The Smart Contract Cloud”. It’s for those
who would like to adopt Smart Contracts, verify transactions on a third
party block explorer, and add security, trust, and validity to their
data.</p>

<p>We provide an API wrapper so that you can easily launch a Smart Contract
on our platform. You can then create accounts for your users that you
can map to your own internal IDs without having to worry about the
blockchain layer.</p>

<p>This makes life a lot easier for those teams who would like to enjoy the
benefits of using an EOSIO blockchain, but who aren’t quite ready to
take on all the complexities of Smart Contract development from scratch.
They can get their app connected to a Smart Contract and get things
flowing fairly quickly. If they like, down the line they can then take
over completely. We will provide the Smart Contract(s) to them and sign
over the active and owner keys.</p>

<p>This effectively makes us an EOSIO adoption engine – we help companies
get up and running with EOSIO Smart Contracts without having to think
about hiring specialist blockchain developers. They can use Smart
Contracts to improve the security and validation of their data with
their current resources –  recently one of our customers who were using
a JavaScript developer with only six months’ of experience found it very
easy to integrate Smartpress with their frontend.</p>

<p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Code showing how easy it is to use Smartpress smart contracts using

<h2 id="what-inspired-you-to-create-smartpress">What inspired you to create Smartpress?</h2>

<p>The inspiration came from our experience at the<a href="https://eos.io/news/hacking-on-one-year-on/">EOS Global
Hackathon</a> event in Sydney
in August 2018. There were hundreds of participants there, from
different sectors and industries. Only a few of them (myself included)
had significant experience setting up and writing EOSIO Smart Contracts.</p>

<p>When the time came and we started hacking, most teams had to spend a
couple of hours at least getting started with EOSIO, whereas we were up
and running immediately. This gave my team an edge technically and
timewise. But, most importantly, it allowed us to observe and identify
this use case: What if you could set a few parameters, press a button
and have an app produce secure code for you?</p>

<p>We realized this would have saved hundreds of hours of effort at the
hackathon, so we created Smartpress to save time for anyone new to
blockchain and EOSIO technology. This software has the potential to
reach millions of developers in the years to come, and we hope that our
product will have a massive impact by saving them time and money.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-decide-to-use-blockchain-technology-and-specifically-eosio">Why did you decide to use blockchain technology, and specifically EOSIO?</h2>

<p>Blockchain can be used in a powerful yet simple way. A basic Smart
Contract can be used to build trust with your users by allowing them to
audit and verify the data themselves. This is what we believe blockchain
is about: not trusting companies anymore and making them prove to you
that they are doing what they say they are.</p>

<p>EOSIO is the highest quality blockchain software out there. It is highly
performant, which means that data publishing and validation can be done
very quickly. The
<a href="https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.contracts">eosio.contracts</a> repository
has a selection of useful basic contracts which offer functionality with
vetted and robust code.</p>

<p>We also believe in the leadership and vision of
<a href="https://block.one/">Block.one</a>, and that they will continue to innovate
and work to improve EOSIO as time goes on.</p>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Example-of-Smartpress-UI-1024x563.png" alt="Example of
UI" /></p>

<p>The simple and intuitive UI of the Smartpress platform make using EOSIO
Smart Contracts easy</p>

<h2 id="what-stage-is-smartpress-at">What stage is Smartpress at?</h2>

<p>The Smartpress core platform is built and functioning. We have a number
of paying customers and are ready to onboard new users at any time.
Public EOSIO blockchains change over time, due to their governance, and
adoption of changes to the core software. We are constantly working to
keep up to date with these changes which is a compelling reason to use
Smartpress:</p>

<p>The user experience will stay close to constant due to the work we are
doing on the backend of the platform.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-challenges-you-had-to-overcome-and-how-did-you-do-it">What are the challenges you had to overcome, and how did you do it?</h2>

<p>One of the challenges that we are facing right now is convincing people
of the merits of using blockchain technology to solve their problems.
It’s tricky to explain something new and technical to people.</p>

<p>This all makes advertising difficult. So far we haven’t been able to
find a scalable, repeatable model using common digital marketing tools.
We’re getting closer to being able to predict that if we put in X amount
of marketing dollars into a strategy, then we get out Y amount of
revenue. Some days we have a lot of success, and some days we have none
at all.</p>

<p>In addition to improving the effectiveness of our digital marketing, we
are focusing on a “warmer” approach to contacting potential customers.
This involves meeting potential customers at events and conferences. We
plan on attracting new users as a result of our scaling efforts as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Example-of-Smartpress-UI-EOSIO-1024x560.png" alt="Example of UI
EOSIO" /></p>

<p>Smartpress makes it easy to map internal usernames to EOSIO blockchain
account names\</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-plans-for-scaling">What are your plans for scaling?</h2>

<p>We are actively scaling the business by growing the Smartpress customer
base. We are planning on offering a suite of user focused products as
well.</p>

<p>Users will arrive on the site and see that Smartpress is the Smart
Contract cloud, but they will also see a number of products which they
can use built by Smartpress, on Smartpress. This will help us to onboard
new users to Smartpress as well as educating the market as a whole about
the benefits of blockchain technology.</p>

<p>One product which we are working on will solve the problem of document
verification. We can look at education providers to demonstrate why this
would be so useful. If you want to verify that a candidate has completed
a course in programming, for example, you would need to go to the course
provider. You would probably need to go through a support process and
they might send you a letter or an email after several hours of effort
going back and forth.</p>

<p>If they had used our new product, all you would have to do is drop the
PDF of the certificate in, and we would tell you everything you need to
know about it (when it was issued, which grade was attained, which
course it was for, etc). In this way you can vet the candidate for the
job instantly without having to rely on anyone else.</p>

<p>I think these types of verification solutions are going to show people
how quickly blockchain technology can be adopted to save people and
businesses lots of time and effort. A lot of organizations could benefit
from this service: universities dispensing degree certificates, local
councils granting liquor licenses, construction companies who need to
check workers’ forklift licences. They will all have the convenient
option to use a Smartpress product to verify their documents instead of
writing their own Smart Contracts and providing a website.</p>

<h2 id="what-eosio-community-initiatives-have-you-engaged-in-and-how-has-the-eosio-community-responded-to-smartpress">What EOSIO community initiatives have you engaged in, and how has the EOSIO Community responded to Smartpress?</h2>

<p>We have hosted several meetups in Canberra to tell the community about
EOSIO. We are planning to do a lot more outreach in Sydney now that we
are based here. That includes going to meetups and events to tell people
about Smartpress – general technology themed ones, not just blockchain.</p>

<p>We were grand finalists in the EOS Global Hackathon series in 2018 which
was a great opportunity to meet and connect with EOSIO community members
from all over the world. That gave us a headstart with name recognition
in the ecosystem, some great resources, and knowledge about where to go
and who to talk to about all things EOSIO.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-introduce-your-team-and-tell-us-what-makes-themit-special">Can you introduce your team and tell us what makes them/it special?</h2>

<p>The only permanent member of Smartpress right now is me. I have a few
contractors doing design and sales, though. When we originally won the
Sydney EOS Global Hackathon and progressed to the Grand Finale in Cape
Town, there were other core team members. They have since left the
project, due to timing and family commitments.</p>

<p>It is exhilarating (and terrifying) to be in total control of the
company. I can hire people to do what needs to be done and set the
strategic direction, but the consequence of this is that the success of
the business rests solely on my shoulders. I am confident in my ability
to lead and manage Smartpress to achieve profit and growth.</p>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Smartpress-founder-Lachlan-Greenbankp-pitching-1024x585.jpg" alt="Smartpress founder Lachlan Greenbank
pitching" /></p>

<p>Lachlan Greenbank pitches Smartpress at the EOS Global Hackathon Grand
Finale in Cape Town</p>

<p>I started out learning coding when I was 17. I went to a community
college which was fairly laid back. I wasn’t particularly enthusiastic
about higher education at that point in my life – I was more interested
in hanging out and having fun with my friends. I turned out to be an apt
student and even won a coding competition when I was there.</p>

<p>After I gained my college diploma I studied an IT degree at ANU, which
is actually the highest ranked university in Australia. I was two years
into my degree when the EOS Global Hackathons started. I was also
working at a small company and I quit my job there a couple of months
before the events because I thought that EOSIO was something special. It
turned out to be a huge opportunity and I am glad I took the risk and
embarked on this adventure!</p>

<h2 id="where-do-you-see-smartpress-in-the-future">Where do you see Smartpress in the future?</h2>

<p>The core vision of Smartpress remains strong: making it easier for users
and businesses to benefit from EOSIO blockchain technology. Our niche is
simplicity, because I am a simple sort of dude. When I am building
things I like plugging stuff in and getting it done without a whole lot
of configuration and setup.</p>

<p>So we are going to continue to attract customers to our platform by
offering them a convenient and cost effective way to use Smart Contracts
in their business activities. We will be releasing a suite of products
that leverage our platform to offer useful functionality to customers.</p>

<p>Because we are laser focused on providing value for our customers and
demonstrating how our products can save time and effort, we remain
resilient to a range of market conditions. If blockchain explodes in
popularity then that’s great, and we are ready to scale up and onboard a
million users over the next six months. If it takes another few years
though, with slower growth, then we are ready for that too.</p>

<h1 id="prospectors-is-a-gold-mining-economic-strategy-game">Prospectors is a Gold Mining Economic Strategy Game</h1>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Prospectors-BuiltOnEOSIO-1024x585.jpg" alt="Prospectors is an economic strategy game which allows players to
build, trade and
mine" /></p>

<p>We spoke to Nazar Chervinskiy, CEO and co-founder of Prospectors, the
world’s first MMORTES (Massive Multiplayer Online Real-Time Economic
Strategy) game that was built on EOSIO.</p>

<h2 id="could-you-introduce-prospectors-for-us">Could you introduce Prospectors for us?</h2>

<p>On the one hand, Prospectors is a game whose primary goal is to bring
joy to its users; on the other, it is an alternate reality with robust
economic rules and relations where anyone can become whoever they want.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“Just like in the real world, in Prospectors there is more than one
path to success.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We sometimes get comments from our users like “I don’t totally
understand Prospectors, but I play it anyway and I love it!”. It mirrors
the real world – people don’t completely understand that either, but
they can still enjoy it, which is cool.</p>

<p>The game is set in the 19th century Wild West, with a map showing land
tiles and above-ground resources like wood and stone. There are also
resources hidden underground which must be sought out, like coal, clay
and gold. Each of these resources has a different role to play in the
construction of new buildings and the production of items.</p>

<p>Every player has three assigned workers who can fulfill various tasks.
Players can use their workers themselves, or have them work for other
players in return for a salary. Any action in the game requires labour
from a worker to complete it. No matter how active you are, you’ll still
need some help from others in the game.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-prospectors-different-from-other-traditional-games-like-it">What makes Prospectors different from other, traditional games like it?</h2>

<p>We’ve created a new type of game and called it MMORTES – Massive
Multiplayer Online Real-Time Economic Strategy. This means players can
interact to trade resources, build things, or mine for gold. This is
underpinned by our leveraging of blockchain technology, which makes
Prospectors more transparent and helps us to earn players’ trust.</p>

<p>The game is also educational – it can help players learn about
transactions and financial relationships. It offers the possibility of a
side income derived from something they enjoy.</p>

<p>Is Prospectors profitable for a player? It depends on the strategy they
choose. Just like in the real world, there is more than one path to
success, which makes pinpointing a winning formula difficult.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“Players are responsible for their own destiny in Prospectors.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can try to realize themselves as ordinary workers, receiving
salaries from other players or opt to be a builder, miner or courier.
They can even start their own businesses, creating job opportunities for
others.</p>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Prospectors-Mine-Gold-Build-Your-World-1024x452.jpg" alt="Prospectors - Mine Gold Build Your
World" /></p>

<h2 id="what-inspired-you-to-create-prospectors">What inspired you to create Prospectors?</h2>

<p>I’ve been a fan of video games since childhood and always imagined what
I would do if I had been in the game developers’ shoes.</p>

<p>There was a period early in my career when I only had to work in the
summer, which meant that I could spend all winter playing video games.
That’s when I became acquainted with
“<a href="https://www.travian.com/">Travian</a>”. This real-time massively
multiplayer game was active and bustling with other players 24 hours a
day, which made it very engaging.</p>

<p>In 2014, I first dove into the world of blockchain technology and
cryptocurrency. I thought back to Travian and the numerous communities
of players constantly interacting on a vast game map. I dreamt of
creating a game based on blockchain that would challenge and elevate
this experience.</p>

<p>For two years I discussed the possibilities of Prospectors with my
cousin and co-founder Andriy Maslijevych. We wanted our game to stand
out and decided that by offering players something in exchange for their
time spent playing, we could achieve that. Their efforts add value to
the game’s world and in return accumulate various digital assets they
truly own and can sell anytime.</p>

<p>We weren’t sure how our monetization model would be received by gamers.
However, Steemit launched around this time, which proved the viability
of users being rewarded for contributing value to their ecosystem.</p>

<p>The newer Prospectors game map, set in the Yukon and interfacing with
the WAX EOSIO blockchain, was inspired by the works of Jack London. His
gritty tales of harsh conditions during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush in
the Yukon were extremely evocative. It seemed only appropriate to pay
homage to the brave souls venturing to new lands in search of their
fortune in our own unique way.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-decide-to-use-blockchain-technology-and-specifically-eosio">Why did you decide to use blockchain technology, and specifically EOSIO?</h2>

<p>We had been excited by blockchain technology, and were searching for new
ways to apply it in the real world. We ended up making a totally
blockchain powered game on EOSIO – all actions are in-line smart
contract actions.</p>

<p>We originally spent time using Ethereum smart contracts, but found the
platform too slow and expensive for our needs.</p>

<p>The primary argument for our use of blockchain technology stems from the
operation of the virtual in-game currency, Prospectors Gold (PGL). We
are striving to represent an alternate reality with full-fledged
economic relations between its citizens.</p>

<p>To provide this experience, players need to be able to trust that we
cannot generate unlimited PGL for ourselves and believe us when we say
we don’t know the locations where PGL is buried underneath the map.
EOSIO blockchain technology allows us to be transparent about both of
these things because PGL is defined and transacted by a smart contract.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“Earning players’ trust is going to become increasingly more
important in the highly competitive world of video gaming. EOSIO
blockchain technology is a good tool to achieve this.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We were well aware of the capabilities of competing blockchain platforms
when we made the decision to use EOSIO. We were already familiar with
the works of Dan Larimer and planned to use Bitshares then pivoted, when
we heard the announcement of EOSIO. It has totally lived up to our
expectations.</p>

<h2 id="what-stage-is-prospectors-at">What stage is Prospectors at?</h2>

<p>In terms of development, we are at, and plan to be at the open
beta-version stage for at least another six months.</p>

<p>Players can sign up and play the game in their browser right now, using
a compatible wallet. We consider Prospectors to still be in open beta
because we are actively extending the functionality of the game, and
this will influence the economics. We would like to avoid interfering
with the economic model of the game after the official stable release,
though.</p>

<p>As for the game itself, I would suggest that the current version is in a
period of initial capital accumulation. The distribution of gold is
happening according to “true proof of work” where more work in the game
world earns more gold.</p>

<p>We have so far built the core game, which is only around 10% of our
planned functionality.</p>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/An-in-game-view-of-Prospectors-1024x571.jpg" alt="An in-game view of
Prospectors" /></p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-challenges-you-had-to-overcome-and-how-did-you-do-it">What are the challenges you had to overcome, and how did you do it?</h2>

<p>In the beginning there was just my cousin Andriy and I!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“We had no experience of the video games industry so we had to learn
everything along the way, which was a significant challenge for us!”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Creating a game as complex as Prospectors required a lot of time and
effort. Balancing the economic model was particularly difficult, and
economists we consulted didn’t even believe it would work. It is now
running smoothly though, and needless to say we are happy to prove them
wrong!</p>

<p>We had no clue about marketing and lacked the funds for even a small PR
campaign, so had to find our own ways to get our messages out there.</p>

<p>We couldn’t have overcome these challenges without our magnificent team.
Notably, many who joined us in the beginning left higher paying jobs.
Through working on Prospectors, we all gained some totally priceless
experience, and have become stronger together (emotionally at least!).</p>

<p>We currently have two main game worlds: Wild West and Yukon, which use
the EOS and WAX blockchains respectively, and we plan to launch at least
two more. Each new world will contain unique resources, and players will
be able to travel between them using railways.</p>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-two-worlds-available-in-Prospectors-Yukon-and-Wild-West-1024x477.jpg" alt="The two worlds available in Prospectors, Yukon and Wild
West" /></p>

<p>Players will become familiar with the railway game mechanic, because we
are also planning to host temporary new maps which will contain
resources to collect. They will have to work together, and can only take
resources back with them if they successfully build a new railway.</p>

<p>They will need to balance collecting resources with construction,
otherwise no-one will take home anything.</p>

<h2 id="what-eosio-community-initiatives-have-you-engaged-in-and-how-has-the-eosio-community-responded-to-prospectors">What EOSIO community initiatives have you engaged in, and how has the EOSIO Community responded to Prospectors?</h2>

<p>We continually keep up with EOSIO community news, and we were the first
project to start providing CPU for players.</p>

<p>We contribute when we can to the development of EOSIO. When we were
starting out on Prospectors, we discovered a bug which could totally
break the Jungle testnet. This <a href="https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/4821">critical
vulnerability</a> could have been
replicated on the EOS public network. We reported the problem to Block
Producers, and they took steps to fix it. </p>

<p>We are grateful to have an incredible community of players, some of whom
came from the EOSIO community to Prospectors, and some the other way
around. Positive comments from them have always kept our spirits high in
the face of challenges.</p>

<p>Some players loved the game so much they became contributors over time,
volunteering to perform tasks like translation and even game
development. Thanks to the efforts of these people, Prospectors is even
better for everyone who plays.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-introduce-your-team-and-tell-us-what-makes-themit-special">Can you introduce your team and tell us what makes them/it special?</h2>

<p>Our team is comprised of 16 people with a similar world view and a
shared belief in our project. Some have been friends with each other
since childhood, and some have joined us along the way. Here are some of
the core members of our team:</p>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Yaroslav-Kikhtan.jpg" alt="Yaroslav
Kikhtan" /></p>

<p>Yaroslav Kikhtan</p>

<p>Our CTO, Yaroslav Kikhtan, has 20+ years experience of software
development. He never tires of learning, and reads everything from the
theory of evolution to philology. He will not believe something unless
it is backed up by grounded research in several different scientific
publications. He is an advocate for more straightforward gameplay –
after his censorship, the majority of our crazy ideas die in agony. He
is an important counterweight in the development process though and
produces robust, well structured code.</p>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Andriy-Masliyevych.jpg" alt="Andriy
Masliyevych" /></p>

<p>Andriy Masliyevych</p>

<p>Andriy Masliyevych is one of our co-founders and a brilliant
mathematician. His head contains seemingly unlimited amounts of
information and he quickly fishes facts out as needed. He finds creative
ways to solve programming problems, and is adept with blockchain
technology.</p>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Max-Karkach.jpg" alt="Max
Karkach" /></p>

<p>Max Karkach</p>

<p>Max Karkach is another co-founder and our lead graphic designer. He
manages our artists and combines their output to produce the visible
world of Prospectors as gamers experience it.</p>

<p><img src="https://eos.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nazar-C.jpg" alt="Nazar
Chervinskiy" /></p>

<p>Nazar Chervinskiy</p>

<p>As CEO, I mainly work on the game design of Prospectors, and also
strategic planning for the whole company.</p>

<p>Our team is fantastic and ready to support each other through hard
times, long nights, and weekends. We celebrate our victories together,
and I count my teammates as genuine comrades-in-arms.</p>

<p>The Prospectors Team</p>

<h2 id="where-do-you-see-prospectors-in-the-future">Where do you see Prospectors in the future?</h2>

<p>As Dan Simmons wrote: “No book or poem is ever finished, merely
abandoned.”</p>

<p>We have a lot of imagination as a team, and usually have more ideas than
time to implement them!</p>

<p>While we have very ambitious plans for the future, I can only reveal a
few things at present. Very soon, the game will allow the formation of
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), which will allow players
to group together to perform work and collect income. These DAOs will
have various jobs available, each with different responsibilities and
rewards. The EOSIO permissions system is perfect for offering this
feature!</p>

<p>Following on from this, we plan to offer players a chance to shape the
experience of the game by introducing elective positions: a Sheriff and
a DAO court. One of the challenges we face is dealing with
multi-accounts (where one player uses multiple accounts to generate more
resources than they should be able to), which are forbidden by the game
rules. It is our hope that the community will help us in the fight
against these cheaters through the DAO court – it may even prove to be a
compelling new dimension to the game for enthusiastic players.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“In time, we hope to pass 100% of the management and strategic
decisions to Prospectors players – DAOs are the first step in
achieving this.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We would like to experiment with a number of different governance
systems, starting with direct democracy via the delegation of voting
rights.</p>

<h2 id="in-a-sentence-how-would-you-want-readers-to-remember-prospectors">In a sentence, how would you want readers to remember Prospectors?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“Prospectors is set in a world of virtual Gold Rushes, where the
gold you mine is defined and transferred by a smart contract to
increase transparency and security.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
