 * Recover an account to a new authority using a previous authority and verification

 * of past ownership and proof of identity to the recovery account. Being able
 * to satisfy an owner authority that was used in the past 30 days is sufficient
 * to prove past ownership. The get_owner_history function in the database API
 * returns past owner authorities that are valid for account recovery.
 *
 * Proving identity is an off chain contract between the account holder and
 * the recovery account. The recovery request contains a new authority which
 * must be satisfied by the account holder to regain control. The actual process
 * of verifying authority may become complicated, but that is an application
 * level concern, not a blockchain concern.

 * If a recovery request was made inadvertantly, the account holder should
 * contact the recovery account to have the request deleted.

 * The two setp combination of the account recovery request and recover is
 * safe because the recovery account never has access to secrets of the account
 * to recover. They simply act as an on chain endorsement of off chain identity.
 * In other systems, a fork would be required to enforce such off chain state.
 * Additionally, an account cannot be permanently recovered to the wrong account.
 * While any owner authority from the past 30 days can be used, including a compromised
 * authority, the account can be continually recovered until the recovery account
 * is confident a combination of uncompromised authorities were used to
 * recover the account. The actual process of verifying authority may become
