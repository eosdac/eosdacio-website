On the 1 st June 2018, eosDAC ERC20 Ethereum-based tokens will be frozen. Over the days that follow, eosDAC will launch as a Decentralised Autonomous Community on the EOS blockchain and all token holders will then be able to take control of their eosDAC tokens and begin to utilise them on the new EOS-based chain.

In June, the eosDAC constitution will be released and the code will be deployed to allow 12 custodians to be voted in by the eosDAC token holders. These custodians will then be able to work together to run eosDAC’s operations, including employment of all key team members. The current Launch Team members will carry on with their activities until the custodians either re-deploy them or replace them.
