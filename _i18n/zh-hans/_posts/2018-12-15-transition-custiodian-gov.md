eosDAC is a groundbreaking project which aims to help build the future of Decentralised Autonomous Communities(DACs). It has been an exciting journey since the initial airdrop and launch of the EOS Mainnet; eosDAC will imminently open voting for Custodians through its in-house coded and designed member client at members.eosdac.io. Custodian nominations and voting will proceed entirely on-chain.
