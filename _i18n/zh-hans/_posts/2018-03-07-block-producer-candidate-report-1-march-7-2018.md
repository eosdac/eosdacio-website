The following is a **randomized list** of current Block Producer Candidates (BPCs) and public contact URLs. The list will be re-randomized every week. The information presented here was submitted directly by BPCs and has been minimally checked by EOS Go volunteers but not verified for completeness or accuracy.

EOS Go had originally committed to posting multiple links for many different forms of BP Candidate contact info. We miscalculated in thinking we could accommodate and process what is turning out to be hundreds of links. We need to simplify and turn over the link-aggregating process to BP Candidates. Please provide us with a single URL that is a clearinghouse for all important public information about your candidacy. The interested public should be able to visit one web page or site with easy-to-find links to your Twitter handles, Steemit informational posts, Meetup.com pages, Telegram chats, Facebook pages, websites, and more.

We apologize for this necessary change in format and will accommodate by **offering to update a BP Candidate's URL listing for up to 5  days** after this first report is posted; please send an email request to: admin@eosgo.io 

EOS Go thanks Block Producer Candidates and the EOS community for their trust in our neutrality. The evolution of the EOS public blockchain launch is ongoing. We appreciate everyone's patience as we refine and optimize the BPC candidate registration process with community feedback. Towards the end of this post we've included a preview of what future BP Candidate Reports may look like, please be sure to scroll all the way down.

### Summary Charts

This chart summarizes how many BPCs out of the current total group size meet each of EOS Go's six [community-reviewed "Checkmark Criteria"](https://busy.org/@eosgo/announcement-grading-criteria-for-eos-block-producers-in-march-7-report) for basic transparency and informativeness:

----------
### The Six Check Mark Criteria

### Preview of Future BP Candidate Reports

Here's the format EOS Go plans to use for upcoming BP Candidate Reports starting with Weekly Report #4 on 2018-03-28 (March 28th.) Note that ordering of BPCs remains random and will be re-shuffled every week:

![Preview_of_CheckBox_report.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPdVZrRB9EB54NTHrgfz5f6Upwhbo9Fd8TvLRojzCCQfi/Preview_of_CheckBox_report.jpg)

----------
### Process Notes

- BPC information is accepted on a rolling basis. The current on-line form for submitting data is [this GoogleForm.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fUJCBzmPpajoFH43Ud3-GTyBpz0LElJikhew0JfDUyg/edit) (NOTE, this link may change over time, be sure you are looking at the most-recent version of this Weekly BPC Report to get the correct link.)

- BPC list randomization is performed with the Shuffle tool in the  [AbleBits Power Tools plugin](https://www.ablebits.com/google-sheets-add-ons/power-tools/howto-shuffle-values-in-rows-or-columns.php#shuffle-values-in-rows-or-columns) for GoogleSheets.

- Why Steem? In the interest of fairness and transparency we request all BPCs to post information on a blockchain-backed platform where content cannot be silently altered or removed. This provides short- and long-term assurance to all parties -- other block producer candidates, EOS token holders, and the interested general public.

- EOS Go includes SHA256 checksums for important data-containing image attachments in our SteemIt posts to ensure long-term content integrity and verifiability. (As of this writing SteemIt does not include a native mechanism for ensuring image integrity, [read more here](https://steemit.com/anti-censorship/@samsapoznick/why-and-how-to-cryptographically-secure-your-steemit-article-images) if interested.)

- Additionally, EOS Go archives a local snapshot of the raw BPC form submission data (a .CSV-format spreadsheet) at the close of each weekly period. The .CSV snapshot will be archived for at least 2 years and its SHA256 checksum is posted in the report. In the event of a serious discrepancy or conflict relating to the BPC registration process a trusted 3rd party (such as an arbitrator) could examine one or more weekly data snapshots to verify their chronological integrity.

Raw form data .CSV snapshot as of the closing timestamp of Reporting Period #1:
File name: 2018-03-07_02_34_00UTC_Snapshot_Block_Producer_Candidate_Form_Raw_Responses.csv
SHA256 checksum: `9835abcf88013f41234a6a4a1859da61c649b9bcce8fa39e9b9917438b1de9a3`
