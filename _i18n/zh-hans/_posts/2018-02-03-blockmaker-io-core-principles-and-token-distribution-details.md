It is the vision of BlockMaker.IO that EOSIO block production should be open for everyone to contribute and benefit. To realise this vision, BlockMaker.IO will be an evolving decentralised autonomous cooperative (DAC) focused on becoming a leading EOSIO Block Producer serving the EOSIO communities worldwide. It will allow all members to contribute to ensuring healthy block production and reap the benefits of Block Producer payments. 

# Core Principles
 

1. **Excellence of Service Provision:**  The primary objective of BlockMaker.IO is to ensure that it is able to continuously produce blocks required by EOSIO software driven blockchains.

2. **Openness and Transparency:** All decisions made by the BlockMaker.IO governance structures and all operations of BlockMaker.IO will be open and transparent.

3. **Support of EOSIO Communities Worldwide:** We want EOSIO blockchains to flourish so we will engage with the communities, listen and support projects that benefit all EOSIO blockchain communities.

4. **Fairness:** BlockMaker.IO will treat all members fairly, reward contributions appropriately and not seek unmerited profits. No one member should have less information about a decision than others.

5. **Independence:** BlockMaker.IO will not seek any stake in, or undue influence over, other block producers. It will also take appropriate measures to protect its own independence. 

6. **Respect of all Constitutions that we aim to produce blocks for:** Each EOSIO blockchain will have its own constitution and BlockMaker.IO will follow this constitution while acting in the interest of all chain token holders.  

# Token Distribution Details

A fixed supply of one million BlockMaker.IO (BMIO) tokens will allow individuals to be involved in the running of DAC and to receive a dividend from the EOSIO tokens obtained from block production activities.

The distribution of these tokens will be as follows: -

* 10% Founding Team
* 10% Bounties and Advisors
* 30% Crowdsale - *Details will be posted soon*
* 50% Share-dropped on the EOS genesis distribution on each EOSIO chain that BlockMaker.IO will support. This share-drop will be to EOSIO token holders on a prorata basis based on number of tokens held.

Tokens will be transferable, however they will need to be locked into a contract if users wish to vote for members of the Governance Board.

The initial BMIO tokens are ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain. These will be moved to the EOSIO chains at the same time as the share-drops and notice will be given of when this will occur for each chain.

*If you want to be a part of BlockMaker.IO, and feel like you are able to contribute time, skills and energy then why wait for the crowdsale?  - get in touch now - drop an email to rob@blockmaker.io*
