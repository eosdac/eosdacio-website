eosDAC’s primary concern is securing the EOS chain which includes the value of the tokens used in Delegated Proof of Stake voting. 
eosDAC has always followed the interim Constitution and RegProducer Ricardian Contract to the best of our ability. Recently a claim was made in Telegram about eosDAC being the “most outspoken in claiming that BPs shouldn’t behave as if they were bound by the Constitution” (source) and “champions of BPs ignoring all governing documents” (source) based on Telegram comments from a member of the DAC (when asked for a source, this conversation was given as a representative sample).
