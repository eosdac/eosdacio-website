**DAC Success**Stories
===

eosDAC is providing advice and assistance to the following DAC projects as they use the EOS blockchain to launch their decentralised and self-governing projects.

As part of our mission to enable the formation of new DACs, we are assessing the needs of these and other potential organisations and building our DAC Factory – with functionality like member registration, Custodian voting and on-chain worker proposals and multisig payments – to integrate with their requirements. Where requested we are also providing peer code review, airdrop advisory and other guidance.
