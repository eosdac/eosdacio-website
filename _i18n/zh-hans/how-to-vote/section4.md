One **final thing!**

To prevent block producers from benefiting from people who vote once and then don’t stay active, all votes decay at a half life of 50% per year. This means , you’ll need sign back in every once in awhile and click on “vote” again to refresh your votes. Nice thing is that your account remembers who you voted for last, so if you’re still happy with the same producers you just click the vote button and run it all through again.
