#### What does the EOSDAC token do?

- EOSDAC tokens give the holders the **ability to become an eosDAC registered member** upon agreement of the [constitution](https://members.eosdac.io/constitution) on the [member client](members.eosdac.io). The more tokens you have the greater benefits you may have.

- Being an eosDAC member gives registered token holders the ability to [vote for and elect Custodians](https://members.eosdac.io/votecustodians) to represent the token holder. Custodians will decide how to allocate the DAC's revenues through signing on-chain multi-sig worker proposals.

- EOSDAC registered members and/or token holders may receive airdrops of projects that use the eosDAC "DAC FACTORY" to launch their own DACs with.

- Registered EOSDAC token holders will be eligible to submit worker proposals to do paid work for eosDAC or EOS ecosystem. 

- Registered EOSDAC token holders may be entitled to distribution of profits if the elected Custodian board votes to do this.
