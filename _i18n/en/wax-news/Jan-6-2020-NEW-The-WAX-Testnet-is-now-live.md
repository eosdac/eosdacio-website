**NEW: The WAX Testnet is now live**
================================

Jan 6, 2020

Yet another resource for developers to build on WAX is now live - the
WAX Testnet. With the WAX Testnet, anyone can explore building on the
WAX Blockchain for free. It’s “perfect for testing dApps, node setup, or
just exploring the features of WAX,” says [*WAX
sw/eden*](https://waxsweden.org/), the WAX Guild that built the WAX
Testnet.

**Visit the** [**WAX Developer Hive
Quickstart**](https://developer.wax.io/dapps/wax-testnet-quickstart/) **for
the WAX Testnet to learn** how to create Testnet accounts and deploy
your smart contracts to the WAX Testnet, and visit the [**WAX
Blockchain
Environments**](https://developer.wax.io/dapps/blockchain-environments/) **section
for WAX versions, URLs, and development environment information. You
can also access *WAX sw/eden*****’s resources for the WAX Testnet and
create an account** [**here**](https://waxsweden.org/testnet/)**.**

Developers can benefit from using the WAX Testnet in a few ways:

-   **Free testing environment:** The WAX Testnet provides devs with
    free test WAX Tokens, which means you can see how your dApp will
    work on WAX without having to pay for resources
-   **Migration made easy:** If you have a dApp running on another
    blockchain, you can test the migration using the WAX Testnet before
    deploying on the WAX Blockchain mainnet
-   **Experiment with WAX services (coming soon):** Integrate and test
    WAX features such as the [WAX Cloud
    Wallet](https://wax.io/blog/introducing-the-wax-cloud-wallet-the-last-mile-in-blockchain-has-been-solved),
    [WAX Decentralized Random Number
    Generator](https://developer.wax.io/drng/), and [Simple Assets NFT
    smart
    contracts](https://developer.wax.io/dapps/create-non-fungible-tokens-nfts/)
