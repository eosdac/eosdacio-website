Introducing *WAX Labs*, a worker proposal system designed to grow the
WAX Blockchain through decentralization and innovation. There
are **presently more than** [**75
million**](https://wax.bloks.io/account/eosio.saving) **WAX tokens worth
millions of dollars in the*****WAX Labs*****fund**, which is allocated
towards compensating developers who build upon the WAX Blockchain **over
many years**, making *WAX Labs* the largest community-owned worker
proposal system in the entire blockchain ecosystem.

With such a well funded worker proposal system, WAX hopes to build the
most extensive network of blockchain developers in the world.

**Candidates can submit their projects for consideration, and WAX Token
holders can vote on them, [here](http://labs.wax.io/)**


**About the WAX Labs worker proposal system:**
---

*WAX Labs* incentivizes developers to build new projects on WAX, work on
community needs, patches, and upgrades. In exchange for their time and
effort contributing to the development of WAX, these developers will be
eligible to receive WAX Tokens from the *WAX Labs* fund, which will
provide support for WAX development efforts for **many years to come.**

**Projects that will have a clear positive and measurable impact on the
WAX ecosystem are eligible to be funded.** If you request more funds for
your project than the Reviewers and voters feel is appropriate for the
projectâ€™s anticipated value to the WAX ecosystem, the project may not be
approved (but is eligible for resubmission). Projects will not be
approved if they are functions of another role in the WAX ecosystem that
also earns WAX Tokens (ie: WAX Guild functions).

Through *WAX Labs*, the WAX Community benefits from a decentralized
structure by reducing the reliance on a single source for new additions.
This system is beneficial for everyone including:

-   The **developers** who are compensated for their efforts
-   The **community** for having access to additional resources
-   The **WAX organization**, which can leverage the creativity of the
    community to advance projects

*WAX Token holders: please be advised that voting for WAX Labs projects
does not affect your vote strength or stake weight.*


**How to submit a project to WAX Labs:**
---

-   To submit a project for consideration, visit the WAX Labs portal
    [here](https://labs.wax.io/). Complete a candidate profile, then
    submit your project.
-   Reviewers, selected by a committee which is selected by the WAX
    Guilds, will assess your project. If the Reviewers approve your
    project, it will be put forth to the WAX Community who has 30 days
    to vote on whether to accept or reject it.
-   For your project to be accepted, 35% of the entire amount of WAX
    Tokens that are staked must be voted towards your project (ie: if
    there are 1 million total WAX Tokens staked, then 350,000 of those
    must be voted towards your project).
-   If your project is accepted, you will receive payments of WAX Tokens
    in order to fund your project in accordance with the schedule you
    requested during the submission process.

*Please note that WAX Labs will establish its own governance rules in
order to ensure both project quality and project completion, including
making payments based on achieving project milestones.*
