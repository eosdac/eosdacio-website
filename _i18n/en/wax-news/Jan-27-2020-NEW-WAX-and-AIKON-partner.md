WAX and AIKON are excited to announce a partnership that will bring
AIKON’s ORE ID blockchain identity service to the WAX Blockchain,
**making it easy for developers and companies to get their customers
using WAX**. AIKON will make their ORE ID API library, which is geared
toward **streamlining enterprise adoption of blockchain solutions**,
accessible to developers who build on WAX.

By partnering with AIKON, **the WAX community benefits from increased
cross-chain compatibility, and it becomes easier for both small dApps
and enterprise-level applications to move onto WAX**. AIKON’s ORE ID
provides numerous enterprise solutions including a completely seamless
blockchain on-ramp experience for existing centralized apps, a single
API library that supports multiple chains and data privacy conscious
identities.

-   **ORE ID Enterprise** provides one of the easiest ways for
    enterprise customers to transition their existing users to the
    blockchain and can be adapted to any onboarding experience.
-   **ORE ID libraries** will support a multitude of chains including
    WAX, EOS, Ethereum, TRON and more, allowing developers to launch
    their dapps on multiple chains easily with one API.
-   **ORE ID as an identity solution** was built with privacy and
    security in mind and provides tools to manage GDPR and CCPA
    compliance.

With these solutions, **dApps from other blockchains such as Ethereum
and TRON can easily port their application over to the WAX Blockchain.**
And enterprises interested in adopting digital assets can leverage WAX’s
powerful asset exchange tools by migrating their users to the WAX chain.

AIKON has long been inspired by the team at WAX and the scale they’ve
been able to accomplish. “Everyone on our team loves WAX - **especially
their focus on usability and mass adoption**,” said Marc Blinder, CEO of
AIKON. “ORE ID brings that same emphasis on usability for centralized
companies that want to make the move to blockchain or dApps that want a
single sign-on solution for multiple chains.”

"WAX is really excited for AIKON to join the platform,” says Evan
Vandenberg, Director of Business Development for WAX. “**AIKON’s
outstanding team has shown significant progress in onboarding
enterprise-level customers, outside of the blockchain space, to utilize
blockchain technology such as [Moonlighting.com](https://www.moonlighting.com/).** I’m very excited
that the AIKON team can bring their impressive tech offerings to the WAX
development community. "

Together, AIKON and WAX hope to provide that tipping point that large
enterprises have been waiting for in their consideration to adopt a
blockchain strategy.

About AIKON:

ORE ID was built from the ground up to leverage blockchain and manage
access rights to a user's data. We knew from the beginning that
protecting a user would be critical to the mainstream adoption of
blockchain technologies, and data privacy compliance is one of the most
obvious, and in the current technological climate, paramount use cases
that can really deliver value and security to the masses.
