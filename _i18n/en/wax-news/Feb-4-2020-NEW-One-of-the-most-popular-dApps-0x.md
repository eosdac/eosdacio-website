===========================================================================================

One of the most popular dApps on Ethereum is coming to the WAX
Blockchain. 0xGames, an open-economy game development company, is
integrating the [WAX Blockchain](https://wax.io/) into both their arena
RPG game 
[0xWarriors](https://0xwarriors.com/?utm_source=cointelegraph&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=WAX-to-WR)
 and race manager game
 [0xRacers](https://0xracers.com/?utm_source=cointelegraph&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=WAX-to-WR)
 in February, 2020.

The partnership is expected to promote cross-chain interaction for
gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike. 0xRacers and 0xWarriors already
boast the support of several chains, such as Ethereum, NEO, TRON, and
EOS, increasing overall interplay in the player base.

Players can buy, sell, and trade in-game items for 0xWarriors and
0xRacers using WAX Tokens. These NFTs can be of various rarity values
and, when equipped, allow gamers to customize their playing experience
and to curate collections. For example, a player can pick a
legendary-tier WAX helmet along with other equipable tokens and crush
their enemies on the Combat Arenas. Should a warrior need to swap their
WAX item to another one - it can be easily done on the in-game market
supporting NFT trade.
