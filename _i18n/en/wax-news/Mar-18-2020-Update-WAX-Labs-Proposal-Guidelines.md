**Update: WAX Labs Proposal Guidelines**
====================================


Since the launch of the WAX Labs worker proposal system on March 11,
we’ve been excited to see the number of projects submitted for funding!
Below we’ve provided more specific guidelines for how to make your
project more likely to be accepted into WAX Labs.\

The guidelines are not a formula: adhering to them won’t guarantee that
a project is accepted (and likewise, not following them won’t guarantee
that a project is rejected). The guidelines are simply to provide
candidates with the criteria for what makes a project more likely to be
accepted into WAX Labs.

**Guidelines:**

For the benefit of all participants, the WAX Tokens that will be granted
must fund projects that have a clear and measurable impact on the WAX
ecosystem. For this reason, projects are more likely to be accepted if
they are:

-   **Valuable to the larger WAX community and ecosystem (not simply a
    profit-generator for the candidate). **If the project’s primary goal
    is for the candidate to profit from, and it lacks clear benefits to
    the rest of the WAX ecosystem, the project will be subject to a
    higher degree of scrutiny.
-   **Requesting a reasonable number of WAX Tokens. **In general, the
    more tokens that are requested to fund a project, the higher the
    scrutiny of the project.
-   **Within the limits of the number of tokens that will be granted per
    project.** You can request up to \$100,000 worth of WAX Tokens for
    your project, or 0.5% of the entire pool, whichever amount is lower
    at the time of submission. If you have a bigger project in mind,
    great! We recommend first submitting a smaller, lower cost MVP
    (minimum viable product) version of your project, to prove that the
    market and its participants want your larger-scale version of the
    project. Doing so will increase the likelihood that your large-scale
    project will be accepted (if the MVP version is a success).
    Large-scale projects with no previous case study will be subject to
    a higher degree of scrutiny.

-   **Adhering to an incremental utility standard.** This includes
    consideration of:

-   **Measurably useful and/or valuable.** Each phase of the project
    completion must prove utility and community adoption. Projects that
    have clearly defined goals that can be measured objectively, and
    after each milestone, are more likely to be accepted.

These guidelines are suggestions to help candidates submit projects that
are more likely to be accepted into the WAX Labs worker proposal system.
Adhering to none, all, or any of the above guidelines is not a guarantee
of acceptance or rejection; they are intended to provide clarity into
what factors are considered when the Reviewers accept or reject a
project. We look forward to seeing your project submissions, if you have
