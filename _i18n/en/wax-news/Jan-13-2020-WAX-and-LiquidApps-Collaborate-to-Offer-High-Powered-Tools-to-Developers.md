**NEW: WAX and LiquidApps Collaborate to Offer High-Powered Tools to Developers**
=============================================================================


WAX and LiquidApps are excited to announce a collaboration that will
make WAX a remarkably scalable and interoperable blockchain for
decentralized applications. WAX will integrate LiquidApp’s DAPP Network,
providing developers who build on WAX with the most efficient and
cost-effective tools and environments.

The DAPP Network makes the development of dApps more affordable,
efficient and scalable through a range of products for developers,
service providers and users committed to scaling the blockchain. The
DAPP Network brings a of services to developers building on the
blockchain including:

-   [**LiquidLink**](https://liquidapps.io/liquid-link) allows dApp
    developers to connect their dApp to assets, actions, and
    applications on Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOSIO chains, and more.
-   [**LiquidOracles**](https://liquidapps.io/liquid-oracles) keep SLAs
    and data verification on-chain, which protects dApp developers from
    the risks of malicious or accidental failure.
-   [**vRAM**](https://liquidapps.io/vram) is an alternative storage
    solution for developers building EOS dApps that is RAM-compatible,
    decentralized, and enables storing & retrieving of potentially
    unlimited amounts of data affordably and efficiently.
-   [**Zeus SDK**](https://liquidapps.io/zeus) provides developers with
    a set of libraries, code samples and documentation for building and
    scaling dApps, while optimizing the utility of LiquidApp’s products.

These solutions boost WAX’s scalability and cross-chain compatibility
with EOSIO chains as well as other blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin,
and others. It’s like having a Rosetta Stone for the major blockchains.

LiquidApps is excited by WAX’s rapid adoption by users and partners, and
the WAX Blockchain’s scalability potential. “**We have been following
WAX developments closely and we are thrilled to see WAX enable the DAPP
Network to enhance their growing ecosystem**,” says Beni Hakak, CEO
LiquidApps. “The services running on the DAPP Network can **help WAX
developers by offering them more cost-efficient resources, more
flexibility, and more trustless functionality when building their
dApps, keeping WAX at the tip of the spear of blockchain innovation.
This move sets the stage for networks of interoperable, integrated
blockchains to emerge.**“

By bringing the best toolsets and products for developers wanting to
build on WAX, we’re creating an easier and more cost-effective
environment for dApps to operate in.
